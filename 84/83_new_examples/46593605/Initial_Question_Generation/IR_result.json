        "Question": "Does the video clearly show Emma Stone making the comment about Jo Koy being an 'a--hole'?",
        "Answer": "Yes, the video clearly shows Emma Stone making the comment about Jo Koy being an 'a--hole.' In the video, Emma Stone describes her long relationship with Taylor Swift and jokingly states, 'But what an a-hole,' in reference to a humorous context that is tied to the awards ceremony. This specific comment aligns with coverage from several reputable sources, confirming that she made the remark during the Golden Globes event. The evidence indicates that Emma Stone's comments were made while she was speaking affectionately about Taylor Swift, amidst the backdrop of Jo Koy's attempted jokes that did not resonate well with the audience. Additionally, reports note that Stone's joke was perceived as lighthearted banter, implying there was no actual animosity in her comment, but it reflects humor tied to the event's context. Jo Koy's jokes during the ceremony received backlash, further contextualizing Stone's comment and showcasing how her remark was part of a comedic exchange rather than a serious insult.",
