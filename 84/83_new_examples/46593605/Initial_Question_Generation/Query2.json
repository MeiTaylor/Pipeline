Many critics felt the film did not successfully scrutinize the federal government’s oppression of Indigenous people. And others, including  of “Reservation Dogs,” felt it normalized violence toward Indigenous communities.\nGiven the sensitive nature of the material,  encouraged community members to view the film “when and only if you feel ready.”\n“The most pressing thing I’ve wanted to say about Killers of the Flower Moon, especially to Native Women & Youth: See it when and only if you feel ready, and see it with people you feel safe with,” Gladstone wrote on social media when the film opened in October. “You’ll likely have a lot of generational grief to process.

Pedro Pascal to “suck it” during his acceptance speech, while “The Bear” actress  during her time on stage, apologizing to all the people she forgot to thank, “unless you were mean or something.”\nMegawatt couples Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner, as well as Ali Wong and Bill Hader, also made their romances known with PDA throughout the show. And Margot Robbie won the red carpet with yet another “Barbie”-inspired look, recreating a 1977 dress worn by the Mattel doll.\nHere are some of the other major moments you might’ve missed:\n]\nJo Koy bombs with opening monologue, Taylor Swift joke\n------------------------------------------------------\n!\nThe stand-up comedian had a rough go in , earning groans  during his opening monologue for off-color jokes about “Barbie” (“a plastic doll with big boobies”) and “The Color Purple” (“what happens to your butt when you take Ozempic”), among others.

Lawrence could later be seen tearing up as Stone delivered her speech, while their mutual friend, Swift, also gave a standing ovation.\nCillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. charm in ‘Oppenheimer’ acceptance speeches\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n!\n claimed the broadcast’s cutest moment when he won best drama actor, receiving a big kiss from his wife, Yvonne McGuinness, who tried to wipe her makeup off his face. “First question, do I have lipstick all over my nose?”...[Content truncated]",
