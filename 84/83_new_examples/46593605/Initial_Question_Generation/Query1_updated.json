This is for every little rez kid.\"\nWhile Gladstone\u2019s performance was critically acclaimed, the film, a Martin Scorsese-directed crime drama that delves into the serial murder of members of Osage Nation known as the Reign of Terror, divided Indigenous audiences. Many critics felt the film did not successfully scrutinize the federal government\u2019s oppression of Indigenous people.

I played a teacher, and my whole family, they're teachers. All going back generations. Teachers are good people,\" Giamatti said. \"They do a good thing. It's a tough job.

But with an unfunny host and no entertainment factor, they were \"just plain dull\".\nIt was the truest moment the television cameras captured at the Golden Globes: an unidentified woman sat at a table and let out a giant yawn. This year was meant to reinvent the awards, which were nearly destroyed when a 2021 Los Angeles Times report found lack of diversity and accusations of corruption in the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group behind the Globes at the time. But the reconstituted group running things now couldn't have intended the event to be so earnest and just plain dull, from Jo Koy, the blandest, least funny host in recent memory, to the sober, safe acceptance speeches. There were no political statements, no drunken rambling, no jaw-dropping surprises among winners and losers, all the things that made the old show at least fun to watch. Without the entertainment factor, it's easier to see the Golden Globes for what they are: a campaign stop on the way to the Oscars.\nMore like this:\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 25 films to look forward to in 2024\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10 of the best TV shows to watch in January\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How to...[Content truncated]",
