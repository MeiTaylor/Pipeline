Its message: join Army PSYOPS to find, manipulate and become the ghost puppeteer pulling the world’s strings, especially those of hot-button national security threats like the Chinese and Russian governments.\nThe field of PSYOPS may be more relevant than ever as the world reaches the third month of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the U.S. comes out of years of questioning whether Russia was involved in its democratic elections in 2016 and 2020.\nGiven the number of references in the video to Russia and China, it’s also hard not to view this PSYOPS recruiting video itself as a bit of a PSYOP aimed at an overseas audience.\nInformation warfare has been thrust to the forefront of strategic analyses and conversation surrounding the war in Ukraine, with many experts hailing the efforts of the Ukrainian government’s use of propaganda to garner international support and boost Ukrainian nationalism.\nConsider the , a supposed Ukrainian fighter pilot notorious for shooting down Russian planes. The Ghost quickly became an internet sensation, bolstered by official Ukrainian social media accounts, and a symbol of Ukrainian strength and resiliency when facing a much stronger Russian military foe. That’s all well and good, but it should be noted that the pilot wasn’t real.\nUkrainian Air Force officials admitted May 1, two months into the invasion, that the Ghost of Kyiv was just a myth. But that icon, similar to the story pushed and initially verified by the Ukrainian government about the  all dying in defiance of a Russian warship’s order to surrender, has arguably been one of the greatest boons to the Ukrainians’ fight against Russia.\nBoth “urban legends” were pushed as part of Ukraine’s information warfare campaign, a campaign so successful that researcher Sinan Aral  in an article for the Washington Post that, “Ukraine and its partisans are running circles around Putin and his propagandists in the battle for hearts and minds, both in Ukraine and abroad.”\nOld tools of information warfare, like leaflets and loudspeakers, already looked archaic compared to media savvy ISIS propagandists or Taliban Twitter accounts.

To investigate the problematic philosophy behind globalism, I want to look at the music, lyrics, and philosophy of the self-described ‘gypsy punk’ band Gogol Bordello. Using their music as an example, I also want to look at liberal worldliness in the face of global catastrophe. What does it offer? How does it fail?\nAnother question I want to investigate is how liberalism retreats into fascism. Why is it that, given the supposed worldly intentions of liberal capitalists, do they support nationalism?\nTo begin with these questions, the first place that I want to start is the “global citizen.” How does one come to view themselves as a global citizen? From there I will look at the philosophy behind Being-Worldly and Worldliness and then finally arrive at our destination, Gogol Bordello. I will then relate how the band appeals to being a citizen in a global capitalist system. Then we will take a look at how it applies to the Russian-Ukrainian war in 2022.\n!\nGlobal Citizens\n---------------\nTo talk about the global citizenry, we must first investigate how that differs from “the State.” The two categories are often in tension. To have a local mind is to imagine yourself as having ties to the local community and getting involved with the State, and tying oneself to the masts of a national project. This local vision needs to see global interests as hostile, a tragic fall from local ethnic languages and traditions, and to see the borders between people as necessary to preserve a way of life that conflicts with worldly minds.\nHowever, a global citizen sees this as the next stage in human development that we have moved past the need for borders, that we are all involved in — not just statecraft — _but world-craft_. We need to see that we are territorializing the World and stamping out the boundaries that separate State from State, people from others. To maintain peace, we must maintain a unified vision of our collective selves standing relative and in a relationship to differences between people. In other words, we must find a new state, a higher state superseding the development of nations and nation-building to respond to conflict with scientific precision.\nThe global citizen doesn’t attach himself...[Content truncated]",

Details in the footage and satellite images point toward the possible arrival of advanced Russian jets.\nCredit...Maxar Technologies\n*   Feb. 17, 2023\nOn Feb. 7, Iran unveiled a new underground Air Force base called “Eagle 44” in a slick propaganda . On the wall was a clue hiding in plain sight: a poster with silhouettes of fighter jets. One in particular stands out. It’s situated front and center, and is in the shape of a state-of-the-art military jet that Iran currently doesn’t possess, but which officials claim Russia is in the process of selling to them.\nSatellite imagery analysis also reveals what appears to be an at-scale model — what experts call a mockup — of the same type of fighter jet at the base. Combined, the details suggest two things about Iran’s plans: Officials are optimistic about the delivery of these planes, and they could be intending to use this air base to house some of them.\nSince September 2022, Iranian military and political officials have  the supposed purchase of 24 Su-35s, one of Russia’s most advanced combat aircraft.\nRussia has not confirmed the deal, but the details in the video and satellite images suggest Iran is at least making preparations for the arrival of the planes, which officials maintain will happen . It would be the country’s most significant upgrade to its aging fighter jet fleet in decades.\nAdvertisement",

Reversing their gains requires avoiding the mistakes that enabled their rise. This means distinguishing between groups with different goals; using force more judiciously; ousting militants only with a viable plan for what comes next; and looking to open lines of communication, even with hardliners. Vital, too, is to de-escalate the crises they feed off and prevent others erupting, by nudging leaders toward dialogue, inclusion and reform and reacting sensibly to terrorist attacks. Most important is that action against “violent extremism” not distract from or deepen graver threats, notably escalating major- and regional-power rivalries.\nThe reach of “jihadists” (a term Crisis Group uses reluctantly but that groups this report covers self-identify with; a fuller explanation for its use is on page 2) has expanded dramatically over the past few years. Some movements are now powerful insurgent forces, controlling territory, supplanting the state and ruling with a calibrated mix of coercion and co-option. Little suggests they can be defeated by military means alone. Yet, they espouse, to varying degrees...[Content truncated]",
