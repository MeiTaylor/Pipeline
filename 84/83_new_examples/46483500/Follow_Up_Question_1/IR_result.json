Its message: join Army PSYOPS to find, manipulate and become the ghost puppeteer pulling the world’s strings, especially those of hot-button national security threats like the Chinese and Russian governments.\nThe field of PSYOPS may be more relevant than ever as the world reaches the third month of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the U.S. comes out of years of questioning whether Russia was involved in its democratic elections in 2016 and 2020.\nGiven the number of references in the video to Russia and China, it’s also hard not to view this PSYOPS recruiting video itself as a bit of a PSYOP aimed at an overseas audience.\nInformation warfare has been thrust to the forefront of strategic analyses and conversation surrounding the war in Ukraine, with many experts hailing the efforts of the Ukrainian government’s use of propaganda to garner international support and boost Ukrainian nationalism.\nConsider the , a supposed Ukrainian fighter pilot notorious for shooting down Russian planes. The Ghost quickly became an internet sensation, bolstered by official Ukrainian social media accounts, and a symbol of Ukrainian strength and resiliency when facing a much stronger Russian military foe. That’s all well and good, but it should be noted that the pilot wasn’t real.\nUkrainian Air Force officials admitted May 1, two months into the invasion, that the Ghost of Kyiv was just a myth. But that icon, similar to the story pushed and initially verified by the Ukrainian government about the  all dying in defiance of a Russian warship’s order to surrender, has arguably been one of the greatest boons to the Ukrainians’ fight against Russia.\nBoth “urban legends” were pushed as part of Ukraine’s information warfare campaign, a campaign so successful that researcher Sinan Aral  in an article for the Washington Post that, “Ukraine and its partisans are running circles around Putin and his propagandists in the battle for hearts and minds, both in Ukraine and abroad.”\nOld tools of information warfare, like leaflets and loudspeakers, already looked archaic compared to media savvy ISIS propagandists or Taliban Twitter accounts.

On the wall was a clue hiding in plain sight: a poster with silhouettes of fighter jets. One in particular stands out. It’s situated front and center, and is in the shape of a state-of-the-art military jet that Iran currently doesn’t possess, but which officials claim Russia is in the process of selling to them.\nSatellite imagery analysis also reveals what appears to be an at-scale model — what experts call a mockup — of the same type of fighter jet at the base. Combined, the details suggest two things about Iran’s plans: Officials are optimistic about the delivery of these planes, and they could be intending to use this air base to house some of them.\nSince September 2022, Iranian military and political officials have  the supposed purchase of 24 Su-35s, one of Russia’s most advanced combat aircraft.\nRussia has not confirmed the deal, but the details in the video and satellite images suggest Iran is at least making preparations for the arrival of the planes, which officials maintain will happen . It would be the country’s most significant upgrade to its aging fighter jet fleet in decades.\nAdvertisement",

Companies including Facebook and Google have also been criticized since long before the latest Russian invasion for paying too little heed to Kremlin-backed disinformation campaigns in Ukraine, including  that foreshadowed Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\nBut when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in late February, Ukraine suddenly had the world’s attention, including that of the tech companies.

Most notably, they blocked and downranked Russia’s state media outlets, such as Russia Today, which had amassed huge global followings on various online platforms.\nThe moves earned the politically embattled tech giants good press, but they also seemed to be making a difference.

With big state media accounts suspended or muffled, researchers say Russian leaders and influencers have shifted to the semiprivate messaging app Telegram to direct information campaigns via swarms of smaller accounts.\nFor instance, Balaban said he has seen signs of Russian influence in a spate of recent posts that seek to mislead Ukrainians about the safety of fleeing the country or sow division around the country’s military draft.\n“This psychological game is very similar in methodology to 2014 or 2016,” Balaban said. “To find some problems in society, some cracks in society to exploit and create on that basis a conflict.”\nThierry Breton, the commissioner for the internal market of the European Union, who has targeted tech for regulation, said the report from the Disinformation Situation Center exemplifies the need for tough regulations to hold tech platforms accountable.\n“The Russian disinformation war is a...[Content truncated]",

It's also playing out online, where the Kremlin and its allies are using propaganda, , forged documents and  and  to push false narratives, in an effort to deflect blame from Moscow and undermine support for Ukraine.\n\"To defeat Ukraine on the battlefield, Russia needed to strangle all sympathy and support for Ukraine as well,\" analysts at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab wrote in a new  analyzing the Kremlin's information operations in Ukraine.\nA year into the conflict, Russia continues to deploy false and misleading claims to justify its actions, cast Ukraine and NATO as the aggressors, and deny responsibility for the war.\nIt's a continuation of a strategy President Vladimir Putin has pursued long before February 24, 2022 — stretching back to 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and threw its support behind separatists in eastern Ukraine.\nThat includes falsehoods like the claim Ukraine is run by Nazis with support from the U.S., which was the subject of a recent documentary posted online by state-backed broadcaster RT. It's one of 50 such films RT has published since the invasion — nearly one a week — according to , a company that rates news websites' credibility.\nBut the bogus claims don't end there. Russian media and Kremlin-linked campaigns depict Ukraine's government as rife with Satanists and terrorists. They've denied documented atrocities by Russian soldiers against civilians in Bucha and claimed the bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol was faked, using...[Content truncated]"

            "content": "[Content truncated].... “It’s really just lack of resources, lack of investment, lack of preparedness,” and a shortage of staff with Russian and Ukrainian language skills and local expertise.\nThe criticism isn’t novel. While the largest U.S. social media platforms have expanded their efforts to police their platforms globally in recent years, researchers and whistleblowers have consistently pointed out that they  in non-English-speaking regions. Companies including Facebook and Google have also been criticized since long before the latest Russian invasion for paying too little heed to Kremlin-backed disinformation campaigns in Ukraine, including  that foreshadowed Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\nBut when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in late February, Ukraine suddenly had the world’s attention, including that of the tech companies. Under pressure from governments, the public and in some cases their own employees, tech firms  to tackle Russian propaganda and protect Ukrainians online. Most notably, they blocked and downranked Russia’s state media outlets, such as Russia Today, which had amassed huge global followings on various online platforms.\nThe moves earned the politically embattled tech giants good press, but they also seemed to be making a difference. A March 16 analysis by The Post found that social media interactions with major Russian propaganda outlets spiked as the invasion began, then .\nResearchers and Ukrainian officials who spoke to The Post for this story agreed that has dented the Kremlin’s capacity to spread false narratives about the war. In retribution, the Russian government blocked Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter within its borders, though YouTube remains available.\nBut the tech giants’ attention has flagged over time, Ukrainian officials and researchers say, as headlines and public outrage in the United States and Western Europe have shifted from Russian aggression to domestic issues such as inflation,  and, in Europe, the influx of Ukrainian refugees.\nThe Kremlin has taken note. With big state media accounts suspended or muffled, researchers say Russian leaders and influencers have shifted to the semiprivate messaging app Telegram to direct information campaigns via swarms of smaller accounts.\nFor instance, Balaban said he has seen signs of Russian influence in a spate of recent posts that seek to mislead Ukrainians about the safety of fleeing the country or sow division around the country’s military draft.\n“This psychological game is very similar in methodology to 2014 or 2016,” Balaban said. “To find some problems in society, some cracks in society to exploit and create on that basis a conflict.”\nThierry Breton, the commissioner for the internal market of the European Union, who has targeted tech for regulation, said the report from the Disinformation Situation Center exemplifies the need for tough regulations to hold tech platforms accountable.\n“The Russian disinformation war is a...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What specific aspects of the video's production indicate it was designed as a form of war propaganda?",
        "Answer": "The specific aspects of the video's production that indicate it was designed as a form of war propaganda include:\n\n1. **Cultural Fusion**: The video merges military themes with Bollywood-style dance routines, which is intended to project a sense of national pride and resilience among the Ukrainian Armed Forces. This creative expression helps to boost morale and connect with a wider audience, signaling that the military is not just about combat but also embodies cultural identity and community spirit. This aligns with broader trends in which Ukraine has utilized social media to convey messages of resistance and resilience amidst the ongoing conflict, aiming to rally support both domestically and internationally.\n\n2. **Social Media Strategy**: The decision to produce and share this video on social media platforms is a strategic move. The Ukrainian government has been noted for its savvy use of platforms like Twitter to communicate effectively with global audiences during the conflict. This approach serves a dual purpose by providing entertainment and engaging content while simultaneously reinforcing a positive image of the military in a time of war, thereby shaping public perception.\n\n3. **Positive Messaging Amidst Conflict**: The video explicitly promotes themes of joy, camaraderie, and unity among soldiers, which serves to counter the traumatic effects of the war. By framing military personnel in a celebratory context, the video aims to uplift spirits and foster a sense of hope in both the military and civilian populations. Such messaging is crucial during times of war, as it helps maintain morale and public support, similar to the themes found in other official communications from Ukraine throughout the conflict.\n\n4. **Targeting Global Sympathy**: The overall design of the video, from vibrant visuals to the integration of dance, is likely aimed at garnering sympathy and support from a global audience. Just as Ukraine has fought not only on the battlefield but also in the realm of public opinion, the video serves as a tool to engage and attract international attention, thereby rallying support and solidarity from viewers around the world.",
