Unless you were an art-house cinema enthusiast, or perhaps someone who was interested in Eastern Europe, Loznitsa\u2019s films were considered obscure. This, despite the fact that he is a prolific and highly acclaimed director, and possibly the pre-eminent chronicler of post-Soviet history.\nImage\nLoznitsa\u2019s fictional \u201cDonbass\u201d is a grim satire of corruption in separatist regions in Ukraine.Credit...via Film Movement\nIn the months since, two of Loznitsa\u2019s films, the fictional  and the documentary  have received commercial releases in the United States, and dozens of interviews with him have been published, including .\nIn the face of these newest features, however, my churlish initial reactions began to feel beside the point. To watch a Loznitsa film is anything but a passive activity. Consider his documentaries: They are often assembled from archival footage and avoid (or very sparingly employ) the use of obvious editorializing methods like voice-over, interviews and title cards. Instead of providing background information, Loznitsa relies on loaded images carefully selected and organized into montages, which is why his films can sometimes feel like being thrown into the deep end of history without a life vest.\nHis works are also straightforward examples of the entwinement of real-world politics and film production processes. In \u201cBabi Yar: Context,\u201d Loznitsa repurposes World War II footage, much of it originally intended as Nazi and Soviet propaganda, to reveal the cycles of violence that unfolded in the Ukrainian city of Kyiv after the slaughter in 1941 of nearly 34,000 Jews by Nazis and their Ukrainian allies.\n* * *\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The aim of the data collection was to explore filter bubbles, maintained by YouTube\u2019s recommender algorithm, concerning this polarising issue. As a result, a network was detected which showed recommendations relevant to the topic and which was dominated by videos with positive evaluations of the Crimean annexation. A characteristic performance feature of this network is strong mutual relations, as they frequently related back to each other. As there are dependencies between the research design and the outcome, a conceptual discussion of methods in the field was included as well as the claim to broaden the perspective and to ",

The site also presents metrics on how often videos were recommended and by which number of channels. Beyond the undisputedly valuable documentation made by this project, the interpretation of results seems to be especially difficult, as the leading question\u2014\u2018What does AI want you to see?\u2019\u2014is not specific enough and can be interpreted in innumerable ways. This example shows that big data collections might not work in cases of algorithmic personalisation because they are able to accumulate contingencies rather than provide significant evidence.\nWhen searching for a needle in a haystack, there is no need to make the haystack even bigger\u2014instead, the research could experiment with lesser, more intelligent data in order to analyse the way modern propaganda reaches specific groups and users. The impressive report by Christopher Wylie demonstrates the extent to which the examination of cultural biases played into the creation and dissemination of propaganda around the globe \\\\]. To stay up-to-date with these developments the research has to incorporate the perspective of culture studies with their competence in the analysis of choices, which are conditioned by such factors as cultural area, traditions and trends or by ideological presuppositions. Furthermore, cultural mechanisms are crucial for the understanding of new digital practices, as they reflect on the pre-requisites of \u2018social culturalisation\u2019 which, according to Reckwitz, infiltrate the very core of digital technologies:\n> Why is it even necessary to talk about culture here?\u2009<\u2009\u2026\u2009>\u2009The digital computer network is _a culture machine_, which means that its technologies are focused on the production, circulation, and reception of narrative, aesthetic, ludic, or design-based formats of culture. We are all familiar with the thesis that the computer and the internet have brought about an information or knowledge society and have led to a proliferation of information and data. This argument, however, is still too deeply rooted in industrial society\u2019s tradition of thought and its culture of instrumental rationality. It fails to see the most influential aspect of the computer revolution, which is the fact that it has impelled the omnipresence of culture and affectivity. (\\\\], 169)\nThis points to an essential characteristic of YouTube\u2019s recommender. Its aim is to enhance a user\u2019s engagement, which means to entertain and to keep him at the platform as long as possible.

It's also playing out online, where the Kremlin and its allies are using propaganda, , forged documents and  and  to push false narratives, in an effort to deflect blame from Moscow and undermine support for Ukraine.\n\"To defeat Ukraine on the battlefield, Russia needed to strangle all sympathy and support for Ukraine as well,\" analysts at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab wrote in a new  analyzing the Kremlin's information operations in Ukraine.\nA year into the conflict, Russia continues to deploy false and misleading claims to justify its actions, cast Ukraine and NATO as the aggressors, and deny responsibility for the war.\nIt's a continuation of a strategy President Vladimir Putin has pursued long before February 24, 2022 \u2014 stretching back to 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and threw its support behind separatists in eastern Ukraine.\nThat includes falsehoods like the claim Ukraine is run by Nazis with support from the U.S., which was the subject of a recent documentary posted online by state-backed broadcaster RT. It's one of 50 such films RT has published since the invasion \u2014 nearly one a week \u2014 according to , a company that rates news websites' credibility.\nBut the bogus claims don't end there.

Ukrainians tend to get over the bad news fast, or at least their way of coping with it seems to be much more stoic rather than fatalistic. \u201cThere\u2019s no one single demeanour across the country, and everyone\u2019s mood changes every day. But what remains constant is the victorious attitude. Whatever happens, people believe in Ukraine\u2019s triumph. Posts about the imminent victory and the faith in our warriors never vanish from our feeds,\u201d he says.\n!\nEven the most superficial review of just a handful of Ukrainian social media posts reflects this mixture of pain and hope. Although there is a   in the West that social media fuels polarisation and erodes democracy, sometimes helping political figures like Donald Trump rise to power, Ukrainians seem to have  a way to harness the best out of digital communication. Ukrainian Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are brimming with cheerful, often triumphant celebrations of even the slightest military successes, like a destroyed drone or a rocket shut down.

While the largest U.S. social media platforms have expanded their efforts to police their platforms globally in recent years, researchers and whistleblowers have consistently pointed out that they  in non-English-speaking regions. Companies including Facebook and Google have also been criticized since long before the latest Russian invasion for paying too little heed to Kremlin-backed disinformation campaigns in Ukraine, including  that foreshadowed Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\nBut when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in late February, Ukraine suddenly had the world\u2019s attention, including that of the tech companies. Under pressure from governments, the public and in some cases their own employees, tech firms  to tackle Russian propaganda and protect Ukrainians online. Most notably, they blocked and downranked Russia\u2019s state media outlets, such as Russia Today, which had amassed huge global followings on various online platforms.\nThe moves earned the politically embattled tech giants good press, but they also seemed to be making a difference. A March 16 analysis by The Post found that social media interactions with major Russian propaganda outlets spiked as the invasion began, then .\nResearchers and Ukrainian officials who spoke to The Post for this story agreed that has dented the Kremlin\u2019s capacity to spread false narratives about the war. In retribution, the Russian government blocked Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter within its borders, though YouTube remains available.\nBut the tech giants\u2019 attention has flagged over time, Ukrainian officials and researchers say, as headlines and public outrage in the United States and Western Europe have shifted from Russian aggression to domestic issues such as inflation,  and, in Europe, the influx of Ukrainian refugees.\nThe Kremlin has taken note. With big state media accounts suspended or muffled, researchers say Russian leaders and influencers have shifted to the semiprivate messaging app Telegram to direct information campaigns via swarms of smaller accounts.\nFor instance, Balaban said he has seen signs of Russian influence in a spate of recent posts that seek to mislead Ukrainians about the safety of fleeing the country or sow division around the country\u2019s military draft.\n\u201cThis psychological game is very similar in methodology to 2014 or 2016,\u201d Balaban said. \u201cTo find some problems in society, some cracks in society to exploit and create on that basis a conflict.\u201d\nThierry Breton, the commissioner for the internal market of the European Union, who has targeted tech for regulation, said the report from the Disinformation Situation Center exemplifies the need for tough regulations to hold tech platforms accountable.\n\u201cThe Russian disinformation war is a...[Content truncated]",

On the supply side, there are powerful political and commercial incentives for some actors to engage in, encourage, or tolerate deception, while on the demand side, psychological needs often draw people into believing false narratives. Credible options exist to curb both supply and demand, but technocratic solutionism still has serious limits against disinformation. Finite resources, knowledge, political will, legal authority, and civic trust constrain what is possible, at least in the near- to medium-term.\n*   **Democracies should adopt a portfolio approach to manage uncertainty.** Policymakers should act like investors, pursuing a diversified mixture of counter-disinformation efforts while learning and rebalancing over time. A healthy policy portfolio would include tactical actions that appear well-researched or effective (like fact-checking and labeling social media content). But it would also involve costlier, longer-term bets on promising structural reforms (like supporting local journalism and media literacy). Each policy should come with a concrete plan for ongoing reassessment.\n*   **Long-term, structural reforms deserve more attention.** Although many different counter-disinformation policies are being implemented in democracies, outsized attention goes to the most tangible, immediate, and visible actions. For example, platforms, governments, and researchers routinely make headlines for announcing the discovery or disruption of foreign and other inauthentic online networks. Yet such actions, while helpful, usually have narrow impacts. In comparison, more ambitious but slower-moving efforts to revive local journalism and improve media literacy (among other possibilities) receive less notice despite encouraging research on their prospects.\n*   **Platforms and tech cannot be the sole focus.** Research suggests that social media platforms help to fuel disinformation in various ways\u2014for example, through recommendation algorithms that encourage and amplify misleading content. Yet digital platforms exist alongside, and interact with, many other online and offline forces. The rhetoric of political elites, programming on traditional media sources like TV, and narratives circulating among trusted community members are all highly influential in shaping people\u2019s speech, beliefs, and behaviors. At the same time, the growing number of digital platforms dilutes the effectiveness of actions by any single company to counter disinformation. Given this interplay of many voices and amplifiers, effective policy will involve complementary actions in multiple spheres.\n*   **Countering disinformation is not always apolitical.** Those working to reduce the spread and impact of disinformation often see themselves as disinterested experts and technocrats\u2014operating above the fray of political debate, neither seeking...[Content truncated]",
