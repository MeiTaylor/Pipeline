Ukrainians have fought for theirs, earning it and all its flaws, enduring failures and achieving successes since gaining independence in 1991, from the Kuchma protests to the Orange Revolution to 2013′s Maidan social uprising.\n!\nA soldier outside Bakhmut on Jan. 29.TYLER HICKS/NYT\nLast summer, during an interview about private-industry ammunition plants, Ukraine’s Minister of Strategic Industries Alexander Kamyshin touched upon some of his country’s growing pains.\n“I know we disappoint the whole world with all these corruption cases,” he said, referencing  scandal of some regional military commissioners abusing their positions for financial gain. “But we still must fight the greatest war of \\ generation. The war that we thought would never happen in our lives. And if the US and its people keep supporting Ukraine, we’ll make this war never come back again.\n“Because I don’t want my kids to fight with Russians.”\nIt’s amazing how many of these conversations, both over there and back here, find their way to the vision of tomorrow to which we aspire for our children. A friend I served with in Iraq told me recently how wary he is of our involvement with Ukraine. His son is nearing military age, he explained, and he doesn’t want the young man to be sucked into another “forever war,” as occurred with our generation of soldiers.\nForever war. It’s a term lifted from a 1974 science-fiction novel, and it became a type of catchall during the latter half of the war on terror, a way to neatly refer to Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and beyond without getting bogged down in the particulars. The nebulousness sometimes irritated Beltway insiders, but that’s part of why I liked it — it gave everyday people accessible language to contend with armed conflicts they were so often told they didn’t know enough about to speak on.\nThe term has found new life after our withdrawal from Afghanistan, with critics from both the hard left and the hard right using it to attack President Biden, especially since July 2023, when he said, “Our commitment to Ukraine will not weaken. We will stand for liberty...[Content truncated]",
