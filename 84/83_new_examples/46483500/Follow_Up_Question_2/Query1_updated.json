These efforts will make it harder for Russia to rebuild its tanks, manufacture missiles and finance its war.\nSince 2014, regular consultations have taken place in the NATO-Ukraine Commission in view of the direct threats faced by Ukraine to its territorial integrity, political independence and security. The Commission met for extraordinary meetings following Russia\u2019s aggression in Crimea and eastern Ukraine in 2014, after Russia's unjustified use of military force against Ukrainian ships near the Kerch Strait in November 2018 and during Russia's threatening military build-up in April 2021. Other extraordinary meetings of the Commission took place at NATO Headquarters in January and February 2022, focused on Russia's military build-up and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0Throughout the war, NATO and Ukraine continued to consult on the security situation and Allied support to Ukraine through the Commission. In July 2023, at the Vilnius Summit, the Commission was upgraded into the NATO-Ukraine Council, demonstrating the strengthening of political ties and Ukraine\u2019s increasing integration with NATO.\u00a0Furthermore, recognising Ukraine\u2019s increased interoperability and substantial progress with reforms, Allies decided at the 2023 Vilnius Summit that Ukraine\u2019s path to full Euro-Atlantic integration has moved beyond the need for the Membership Action Plan \u2013 changing Ukraine\u2019s path to NATO from a two-step process to a one-step process.\nNATO stands in unwavering solidarity with the government and people of Ukraine in the heroic defence of their nation, their land and our shared values. The Alliance fully supports Ukraine\u2019s inherent right to self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter. NATO Allies remain steadfast in their commitment to further stepping up political and practical support to Ukraine as it continues to defend its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders.\nPractical support to Ukraine\n----------------------------\nIn parallel to its political support, NATO has significantly stepped up its practical assistance to Ukraine. Immediately following the illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, NATO Foreign Ministers agreed on measures to enhance Ukraine's ability to provide for its own security. They also decided to further develop their practical support to Ukraine, based on a significant enhancement of existing cooperation programmes as well as the development of substantial new programmes.\n**_The Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP)_**\nAt the 2016 NATO Summit in Warsaw, the Alliance's measures in support of Ukraine became part of the\u00a0**Comprehensive Assistance...[Content truncated]",
