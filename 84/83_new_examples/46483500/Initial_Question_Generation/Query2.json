James Goldgeier, a leading expert on NATO enlargement, views it as the single most important question for European security.12 And as Mearsheimer notes, “Understanding \\ root causes is essential if we are to prevent it from getting worse and, instead, to find a way to bring it to a close.”13 If Western policy makers incorrectly believe that Russia’s invasion is driven by a nonsecurity motive, they might underestimate Putin’s determination and risk a much wider and potentially nuclear conflagration. If instead they imagine there to be a non-negotiable security imperative where none is in fact present, they may ultimately push Kyiv into making unnecessarily large political or territorial concessions to a predatory regime, setting a precedent that could destabilize international politics.14\nThe debate is now deadlocked—for the most part, proponents of the security and nonsecurity accounts have failed to identify any tractable empirical issues that distinguish their accounts. This article identifies a number of such issues and concludes that the security-seeking account suffers from serious empirical weaknesses. Although the main nonsecurity accounts are analyzed in the next section, the arguments in this article do not distinguish between alternative nonsecurity accounts. However, its conclusions increase their joint explanatory relevance. A broad survey of the existing literature will be useful to frame the discussion that follows.\n#### Mapping the Academic Debate\nIn his famous 2014 _Foreign Affairs_ article, Mearsheimer argued that Putin’s seizure of Crimea, and his unacknowledged military operations in support of pro-Russian separatist elements in eastern Ukraine, were “defensive, not offensive” actions, designed to prevent Ukrainian integration into Euro-Atlantic economic and security institutions, particularly NATO.15 “The trouble over Ukraine actually started,” Mearsheimer writes, “at NATO’s Bucharest summit in April 2008, when George W. Bush’s administration pushed the alliance to announce that Ukraine and Georgia ‘will become members.’ Russian leaders responded immediately with outrage, characterising this decision as an existential threat to Russia and vowing to thwart it.”16 Mearsheimer argues that—in Putin’s mind—such integration would leave Russia vulnerable, in conventional military terms, to a potentially hostile military alliance. Though he acknowledged in his 2001 theoretical treatise that nonsecurity motives “occasionally dominate a state’s decision-making process,” in 2014 Mearsheimer wrote that “Putin’s actions should be easy to comprehend. A huge expanse of flat land that Napoleonic France, imperial Germany, and Nazi Germany all crossed to strike at Russia itself, Ukraine serves as a buffer state of enormous strategic importance to Russia. No Russian leader would tolerate a military alliance that was Moscow’s mortal enemy until recently moving into Ukraine.”17\nMearsheimer insisted that his argument was merely “Geopolitics 101,” and, indeed...[Content truncated]",

Strong forces in the Republican Party once led by Ronald Reagan advocate for appeasing Russian President Vladimir Putin in the name of peace, while the Democratic top aides to President Biden — so committed to half measures when Ukraine was advancing —  that without our continued support, it’d be a matter of weeks or months until Russia broke through Ukrainian defensive lines.\nIn two short years, Ukraine has become something of a forgotten war. Which is remarkable, even by the low standards of the American attention span.\nSome people I know on the ground in Ukraine reject the weeks-to-months estimate as hyperbolic.

Still, there’s no substitute for US military aid. One needn’t be a strategic expert to understand that. Just watch a few viral  of HIMARS rocket-launching systems  faraway command posts, or loitering-munition drones blasting apart deep bunkers, or, most recently, a pair of Bradley armored fighting vehicles  in an open snowy clearing, which could belong in a dystopian film about an alternative Cold War that didn’t keep cold, except it’s real, and it happened in 2024.\n“We need artillery ammunition in large quantities,” Senior Lieutenant Olena Bilozerska of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence texted me. “They’re necessary to break through the enemy’s defenses. We must surpass Russia in this number.” She also pointed to the significance of long-range missiles such as the ATACMS and air defense systems like the PAC-3 interceptor that protect cities and civilians — but it’s artillery that comes up time and time again, no matter who I ask, no matter their rank or assignment or where they are along the front.

On Roblox, the popular gaming platform, a user created an array of Interior Ministry forces in June to celebrate the national holiday, Russia Day.\nThese games and adjacent discussion sites like Discord and Steam are becoming online platforms for Russian agitprop, circulating to new, mostly younger audiences a torrent of propaganda that the Kremlin has used to try to justify the war in Ukraine.\nIn this virtual world, players have adopted the letter Z, a symbol of the Russian troops who invaded last year; embraced legally specious Russian territorial claims in Crimea and other places; and echoed President Vladimir V. Putin’s efforts to denigrate Ukrainians as Nazis and blame the West for the conflict.\n“Glory to Russia,” declared a video tutorial on how to construct a flagpole with a Russian flag on Minecraft.

When we have confirmed access, the full article content will load.\nEzra Klein\n!\nCredit...Michael Houtz\nAt the core of the frenzied interest in Elon Musk’s  is an intuition that I think is right: The major social media platforms are, in some hard-to-define way, essential to modern life. Call them town squares. Call them infrastructure. They exist in some nether region between public utility and private concern. They are too important to entrust to billionaires and businesses, but that makes them too dangerous to hand over to governments. We have not yet found a satisfying answer to the problem of their ownership and governance. But some arrangements are more worrying than others. There are fates worse than Musk.\nTikTok, as we know it today, is only a few years old. But its growth is like nothing we’ve seen before. In 2021, it had more active users than Twitter, more U.S. watch minutes than YouTube, more app downloads than Facebook, more site visits than Google. The app is best known for viral dance trends, but there was a time when Twitter was 140-character updates about lunch orders and Facebook was restricted to elite universities. Things change. Perhaps they have already changed. A few weeks ago, I gave a lecture at a Presbyterian college in South Carolina, and asked some of the students where they liked to get their news. Almost every one said TikTok.\nTikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company. And Chinese companies are vulnerable to the whims and the will of the Chinese government. There is no possible ambiguity on this point: The Chinese Communist Party spent much of the last year  on its tech sector. They made  out of Jack Ma, the high-flying founder of Alibaba. The message was unmistakable: Chief executives will act in accordance with party wishes or see their lives upended and their companies dismembered.\nIn August 2020, President Donald Trump signed an executive order insisting that TikTok sell itself to an American firm or be banned in the United States. By the fall, ByteDance was looking for a buyer, with Oracle and Walmart the likeliest suitors, but then Joe Biden won...[Content truncated]",
