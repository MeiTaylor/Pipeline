The Russian-installed mayor of Nova Kakhovka said on Thursday at least five people had died but the total death toll is sure to be much higher.\nDownstream, UN analysis shows significant flooding along a 90 km stretch of the Dnipro River to the Black Sea. \nHundreds of Ukrainians were rescued from rooftops in the flood-stricken southern region of Kherson on Thursday after floodwaters submerged villages, fields and roads.\nKherson's Ukrainian governor, Oleksandr Prokudin, said 68% of the flooded territory was on the Russian-occupied bank of the Dnipro River.\nThe \u201caverage level of flooding\u201d in the Kherson region on Thursday morning was 5.61 meters (18.41 ft), he said.\nThis map illustrates the areas in...[Content truncated]",

They also continue to monitor the main canal inlets from the Kakhovka Reservoir and are developing methods to use satellites to track how much irrigation water fields receive throughout the summer.\nNASA Harvest analysts will also be monitoring the health of crops using tools such as the GIMMS Global Agricultural Monitoring tool and the AGMET EO Indicator dashboard. These tools had not yet shown a major drop in the greenness of crops by early July 2023 due to regular rains, though the loss of irrigation water could begin to brown crops in the future.\nThe semiarid steppe ecosystems found in the Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts generally receive 100 to 120 millimeters (4 to 5 inches) of rain during the summer growing season\u2014not typically enough for some crops to thrive without irrigation. More than 12,000 kilometers of canals constructed since the 1960s have provided irrigation water for up to 500,000 hectares (1,900 square miles) of croplands, turning the region into one of the most productive farming regions in Ukraine. Canal water is also used for drinking water, industry, and other public uses.\nThe Ukrainian Grain Council has estimated that the flood could lead to a 14 percent reduction in the volume of Ukraine\u2019s grain exports. In late June 2023, NASA Harvest estimated that Ukraine would produce 25 million tons of wheat this year, about two million tons lower than the five-year average. NASA Harvest will continue to monitor the situation in the coming months and will post updates in its news feed.\nNASA Earth Observatory images by Lauren Dauphin using Landsat data from the U.S. Geological Survey, and Planet Labs images courtesy of Inbal Becker-Reshef.

A disaster in photos: Nova Kakhovka dam breach in Ukraine\nA disaster in photos: Nova Kakhovka dam breach in Ukraine\n=========================================================\n!\n\u00a9 People in Need, 2023 (Photographer: Alberto Lores)\nIn the early hours of 6 June, an explosion destroyed a critical infrastructure in southern Ukraine \u2013 the Nova Kakhovka dam. The dam held back the amount of water equal to that of the Great Salt Lake in the USA. This vast amount of water was unleashed downstream along the Dnipro river, flooding dozens of settlements.\nThis disaster has put thousands of lives at risk, making the already dire conditions faced by Ukrainian people even worse. Entire villages have been swept away, the farmland has become unusable, and deadly mines are being washed up onto the shores.\nThe affected communities have been cut off water and electricity, leaving them completely dependent on humanitarian assistance.\nThe consequences of this disaster extend beyond human suffering, as there will likely be significant ecological devastation in years to come.\nTo address the crisis, the EU\u2019s humanitarian partners are providing emergency assistance on the ground. They are delivering drinking water, ready-to-eat food, shelter equipment, and cash assistance.\nIn addition, the EU has  via its Civil Protection Mechanism and rescEU strategic reserves. This assistance includes water pumps, tankers, boats, rescue vehicles, generators, and mobile water treatment stations.\nThe photos below offer a glimpse into the devastating aftermath of the Nova Kakhovka dam breach.\n!\nIn the early hours of June 6, an explosion destroyed a critical infrastructure in southern Ukraine \u2013 the Nova Kakhovka dam.\n\u00a9 People in Need, 2023 (Photographer: Alberto L...[Content truncated]",

The Kakhovka reservoir played a crucial role in providing energy, drinking water, irrigation, and river transport to various regions in southern Ukraine, as well as supplying water for industries in Kryvyi Rih, Nikopol, Marhanets, and other cities and areas. The release of over 18 cubic km of water within a span of 3-4 days poses a significant threat to nearly 80 settlements, potentially affecting around 100,000 inhabitants directly, while up to one million people could lose access to drinking water.\nHowever, the destruction of the dam, beyond these immediate humanitarian needs, will have a significant impact in the longer term on a much larger geographical area and population. It will have severe, long-term impacts on Ukraine's environment, economy and society, including possible displacement and migration of population, and is likely to cast a dark shadow over the country for decades to come.\n1. Health, water and sanitation\nThe Kakhovka reservoir served as a crucial water source for numerous major cities located to the north, west, and south, including Kryvyi Rih, Mykolaiv, Berdyansk, as well as many smaller cities and settlements. The destruction of the dam has disrupted or contaminated the water supply in all these regions. The interruption in water flow has affected not only households but also municipal networks and agricultural irrigation systems in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and Crimea.\nThe flooding poses additional long-term health risks due to discharge of hazardous chemicals from manufacturing plants located downstream. The floodwaters are also contaminated with biological hazards such as sewage wastewater and dead wildlife. This creates a heightened risk of waterborne diseases, including cholera, diarrhea, and others.\nThe water supply challenges resulting from the dam's destruction may also lead to the temporary closure of health facilities, causing disruptions in essential health services. This situation is particularly concerning for the older population and people with disabilities residing in the area, many of whom have chronic noncommunicable diseases. Additionally, the crisis will have a significant impact...[Content truncated]",

It does help imply the broader impact, thereby holding relevance but at a lesser degree."
