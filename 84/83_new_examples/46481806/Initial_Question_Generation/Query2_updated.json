But the real problem most likely lay elsewhere, cloaked deep beneath the surface of the raging waters.\nDeep inside the dam was an Achilles\u2019 heel. And because the dam was built during Soviet times, Moscow had every page of the engineering drawings and knew where it was.\nThe dam was built with an enormous concrete block at its base. A small passageway runs through it, reachable from the dam's machine room. It was in this passageway, the evidence suggests, that an explosive charge detonated and destroyed the dam.\nAt 2:35 a.m and 2:54 a.m. on June 6, seismic sensors in Ukraine and Romania detected the telltale signs of large explosions. Witnesses in the area heard large blasts between roughly 2:15 a.m. and 3 a.m. And just before the dam gave way, American intelligence satellites captured infrared heat signals that also indicated an explosion.\nAfter the first section of the dam was breached, videos suggest that the power of the rushing water tore a larger and larger gash into the dam.\nAs the water levels further dropped this week, they fell below the top of the concrete foundation. The section that collapsed was not visible above the water line \u2014 strong evidence that the foundation had suffered structural damage, engineers said.\nIn the chaotic aftermath, with each side blaming the other for the collapse, multiple explanations are theoretically possible. But the evidence clearly suggests the dam was crippled by an explosion set off by the side that controls it: Russia.\n\r\n\tEven in a war that has razed entire cities, the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam in southern Ukraine stands out.\r\n\n\r\n\tThousands of people were displaced by flooding from one of the world\u2019s largest reservoirs, which was vital for irrigating farmland considered the breadbasket of Europe. The disaster puts global food supplies for millions at risk and could threaten fragile ecosystems for decades.\r\n\n\r\n\tThe dam was visibly scarred by fighting in the months before the breach. Ukrainian strikes had damaged one part of the roadway over the dam, and retreating Russian troops later blew up another. Last month, satellite images showed water flowing uncontrolled over some of the gates.\r\n\n\r\n\tThis has led to suggestions that the dam may have merely fallen victim to the accumulated damage, which Russia has seized on to deny responsibility.\r\n\n\r\n\tBut multiple lines of evidence reviewed by The New...[Content truncated]",

Many are also worried about a return to the dark days of blackouts and no heat this winter following the energy infrastructure attacks that were so prevalent last year,\u201d said Cristina Falconi, Area Manager for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) in Ukraine.\nThe dam was breached in the early hours of 6 June causing extensive flooding, water shortages, drought and widespread environmental damage to several regions close to the Dnipro river including Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia.\nThe government of Ukraine along with civil society groups, national and international humanitarian organisations, are working to establish long-term solutions for water pipelines and repairs of homes. While there have been some initial results, the rehabilitation of pipelines is a complex operation particularly in areas close to active hostilities. This means civilians living in villages could end up facing winter without water and warmth.\nThe fear of displacement is also a reality for some families. Many will choose to leave their damaged homes over the winter, but many elderly residents will choose to remain despite the risks: \"...[Content truncated]",

But large-scale efforts are needed,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe need international organisations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to immediately join the rescue operation and help people in the occupied part of Kherson region.\n\u201cIf an international organisation is not present in the disaster zone, it means it does not exist at all or is incapable.\u201d\nMany hours after the disaster \u201cthey aren\u2019t here\u201d, Zelenskiy told the Bild, Die Welt and Politico news outlets. \u201cWe have had no response. I am shocked.\u201d\nThe destruction of the dam near the frontline in Ukraine has flooded dozens of villages and parts of a nearby city, prompting fears of a humanitarian disaster. Officials have said thousands will have to leave their homes and many are already doing so without assistance. Zelenskiy has claimed the Russian occupation authorities were \u201cnot even trying to help people\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cThe occupiers are simply abandoning people in frightful conditions. No help, without water, left on the roofs of houses in submerged communities.\u201d\n!\n1:19\nShelling heard as boats deployed to thousands at risk from Kherson dam \u2013 video\nUkraine\u2019s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, urged the international humanitarian organisations to provide assistance on the occupied left bank.\n\u201cWe appeal to you to take charge of evacuating people from the territory of Kherson oblast occupied by Russia. We must save the lives of people whom the occupiers have condemned to death,\u201d he said.\nThe UN\u2019s humanitarian affairs office said a team was in Kherson to coordinate relief efforts. It said access to drinking water was a significant concern and about 12,000 bottles of water and 10,000 purification tablets had been distributed so far.\n!\nFlooded streets in Kherson, Ukraine.
