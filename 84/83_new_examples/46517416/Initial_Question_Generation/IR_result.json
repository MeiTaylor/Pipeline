Other states should follow, the Editorial Board writes — with a nudge from Congress.\nDonald Trump policy roundup! On taxes: unrealistic. On immigration: unpopular. On TikTok: unstable — and maybe for sale.\nJen Rubin writes that trickle-down economics is a scam; she pulls from a great deal of research showing that tax cuts for the rich don’t send benefits downstream to the middle class and to poor families.\nShe says Trump’s proposal for “renewing tax cuts for the rich that are due to expire at the end of 2025 would do about as much for you as a degree from Trump University.” The Editorial Board lays out President Biden’s proposals and judges that, though “far from ideal,” they are the much better option.\nOn immigration, things get curious. Catherine Rampell writes that Trump’s actual policies — family separation, militarized detention camps, slashed legal immigration — are on their own deeply unpopular. See, for instance, how well supporting the “dreamers” (the opposite of Trump’s proposal!) polls, even among Republicans:\nYet Trump himself polls much better on immigration than Biden does. Catherine shares her theory on how voters so readily separate the politician from his policies.\nFinally, Josh Rogin tracks how Trump suddenly reversed his position on restricting U.S. access to social media site TikTok — after making nice with a top Republican donor who happens to be a big investor in TikTok’s parent company, which is based in Beijing. The episode suggests, Josh writes, that “there is no foreign policy issue on which Trump can’t be moved by a high bidder.”\nChaser: Non-Trump policies on the right can be unpopular, too!

Biden mobilized his administration around a Cancer Moonshot under the thoughtful leadership of Dr. Danielle Carnival, Deputy Assistant to the President for the Cancer Moonshot and Deputy Director for Health Outcomes of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Anabella Aspiras, Assistant Director of the Cancer Moonshot Engagement. They recognized that the Moonshot must mean innovation in cancer research and public/private collaborations, and it also must mean candor about cancer care inequities. In April 2023, the National Minority Quality Forum (NMQF) convened a diverse gathering at the White House, at which representatives from underserved communities shared stories about the excessive risk and incidence of virulent and aggressive types of cancers that were claiming the lives of their families, friends, and neighbors. \nTheir voices awakened in the insurers, innovative companies, organized medicine, and policymakers at the listening session an understanding that the Cancer Moonshot can succeed only if every American community benefits from its promise. Among the attendees there was the clear realization that the Moonshot must reach long-neglected neighborhoods — not just with words and promises, but also with transformative actions if we are to write the last chapter of the war on cancer. The Biden administration’s willingness to let the voices of the neglected help adapt the Moonshot to...[Content truncated]",

The gun-fire erupted shortly after a Boeing C-17 Globemaster trans-port plane containing 20 al-Qaeda and Taliban detainees took off from the U.S. military base in southern Afghan-istan. The Marines responded to the small-arms fire with M16 rifles and machine guns while two Marine Cobra heli-copters canvassed the area. Photo courtesy of Sgt Thomas M. Corcoran Le Petit Beourge du Decotiis (1st Platoon Defense at Kandahar) \nby Second Lieutenant Art G. Decotiis Marine Corps Gazette, July 2002 \nInitially shorthanded, 1st Platoon established and manned their sector of the defensive perimeter. Due to a series of bumped flights and delays, 1st Platoon arrived in two waves over a span of three days. First Platoon brought up the tail end of Kilo Company’s flow into Kandahar International Air-port. The first Marines to arrive from the platoon were tasked with manning the newly established detainee camp, therefore leaving the platoon short-handed as we occupied our defensive sector in a small adobe-structured village. My company com-mander ordained me the village mayor. Upon the arrival of the rest of the platoon, we conducted a leader’s reconnaissance with the com-pany commander. First Platoon was the final ele-ment of the company to occupy the defense. We were tied in on the right flank of the company sec-tor in a small village on the southwest edge of the runway. A 200-meter gap separated the far right flank of the village and the runway. We were to be tied in with a light armored vehicle that was located another 200 meters away on the opposite \n23 24 \nside of the runway. The span between the two positions was marred with plane wreckage and dead space. Our frontage looked much the same. While conducting the leader’s reconnaissance of the village, several weapons and munitions caches were discovered. We requested that a Marine explo-sive ordnance disposal (EOD) team, along with combat engineers, physically inspect the entire village for live ordnance and mines. Due to the severity of the mine situation, it was extremely dif-ficult to establish our new defense in a traditional manner. Upon a brief evaluation of the sector, we identified those positions we would occupy, and EOD went to work making sure they were use-able. Once the initial positions were deemed safe, we began the occupation by strong-pointing the village, primarily on either flank, along with an observation post (OP) on the roof that would be manned by our Javel...[Content truncated]",

        "Answer": "There is no credible evidence to support the claim that actor Arthur Roberts has been acting as Joe Biden’s body double. The following points illustrate the lack of substantiation for this conspiracy theory:\n\n1. **Snopes Evaluation**: Snopes, a well-known fact-checking website, has addressed the rumor directly, labeling it as “pure nonsense.” They conclude that there is no basis for the claim that Arthur Roberts is Joe Biden's body double, reinforcing the view that such conspiracy theories are unfounded. This establishes a strong counter-argument against the claim [Query2_evidence1].\n\n2. **Public Statements**: In response to the body double rumors, individuals, including public figures, have publicly dismissed these claims as absurd. For example, a video from TikTok features a prominent figure stating that the idea of Joe Biden having a body double is “just crazy” and not true at all, which further undermines the credibility of the conspiracy [Query2_evidence2].\n\n3. **Consistent Messages on Social Media**: Additional communications from Snopes on social media platforms, including X (formerly Twitter), reiterate that the body double narrative about Arthur Roberts is merely a conspiracy theory without evidence. They summarized their position on the matter succinctly, again reinforcing the idea that these claims are unfounded [Query2_evidence3].\n\nGiven the clear and consistent messaging from credible sources, I would evaluate the confidence level in the assertion that there is no evidence supporting the claim about Arthur Roberts as Biden’s body double at **95%**. This high percentage reflects a thorough analysis of reliable sources and strong logical reasoning against the conspiracy claim.",
