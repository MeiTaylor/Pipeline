        "video_transcript": "Pleasure to be with you. First of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, mister president. Thank you, Joe. I, the American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is. What do you what do you wanna say? I'm a man. But it's really legitimate. But, okay, but, anyway, I I I think it's legitimate, and I think it is, and to to enter to any I but I don't think anyone's ever said They've also said, we'd like an apology. International bank over control. We may through international banking. We manipulate the face of all countries. We've introduced many institutions such as the IMF and WTO, that work in our favor to impoverished, disobedient nations. Always remember, death is a powerful weapon against countries that don't share UHIMO's vision. Perhaps our greatest achievement in banking is the Federal Reserve System. It is a collection of international banks owned by Ulricourt members and financiers. It was created to form a centralized banking system in the Federal Reserve Act of 19 13, an act that was indeed penned by some of the most esteemed members. Many of you might still assume that the government itself prints and issues the currency. That is not the case. When America needs money, they go to our boys and ask for it. The money is printed, but it is only representative of a loan. Interest accrues on that dollar until it's paid back to the Fed. In fact, the federal taxes paid by the American population for almost entirely paying off this debt. So you see, Illumicorp derives a healthy amount of its operation funding directly from the debt of the public. Needless to say, this is one of our most crucial sources of funding and one of our proudest achievements here in Louisville. Our technology and manpower will dominate those who oppose the coming new world order. By utilizing American patriotism, we have fostered in the American soldier the philosophy of peace through superior force. When the time is right, we will migrate that mentality towards the belief in a global government who must protect all people through superior force. We have used the American military industrial complex to build the arsenal necessary to instigate the final cleansing outlined in LumaCorp's great plan. Our primary target will be Islamic nations who will never submit to our western centric domination. They also hold much of the remaining oil reserve of the planet. Through LumiCorp's enormous federal funding of the military, we can develop new forms of warfare and population reduction. The public can't imagine what we were in the process of developing. Soon, even the weather. We have weapon under our control. We will be able to create droughts, floods, hurricanes, and even tsunamis with no fingerprints attached. The Medicines know of our unspoken agreement and will 2 party system benefits, Illumicorp, in that it reduces all issues into a black and white debate. Due to a diminishing faith in the system among the public, LumaCorp has designed a rogue candidate program to provide a voice for the dispossessed. This disperses the impetus for dissent among those who do not feel represented by our candidates and builds a database of potential dissidents.",

        "Question": "Is there any credible evidence that Arthur Roberts has acted as Joe Biden's body double?",
        "Answer": "There is no credible evidence to support the claim that actor Arthur Roberts has been acting as Joe Biden’s body double. The following points illustrate the lack of substantiation for this conspiracy theory:\n\n1. **Snopes Evaluation**: Snopes, a well-known fact-checking website, has addressed the rumor directly, labeling it as “pure nonsense.” They conclude that there is no basis for the claim that Arthur Roberts is Joe Biden's body double, reinforcing the view that such conspiracy theories are unfounded. This establishes a strong counter-argument against the claim [Query2_evidence1].\n\n2. **Public Statements**: In response to the body double rumors, individuals, including public figures, have publicly dismissed these claims as absurd. For example, a video from TikTok features a prominent figure stating that the idea of Joe Biden having a body double is “just crazy” and not true at all, which further undermines the credibility of the conspiracy [Query2_evidence2].\n\n3. **Consistent Messages on Social Media**: Additional communications from Snopes on social media platforms, including X (formerly Twitter), reiterate that the body double narrative about Arthur Roberts is merely a conspiracy theory without evidence. They summarized their position on the matter succinctly, again reinforcing the idea that these claims are unfounded [Query2_evidence3].\n\nGiven the clear and consistent messaging from credible sources, I would evaluate the confidence level in the assertion that there is no evidence supporting the claim about Arthur Roberts as Biden’s body double at **95%**. This high percentage reflects a thorough analysis of reliable sources and strong logical reasoning against the conspiracy claim.",
        "Confidence": "95%"
    },
    "CVResult": {
        "Judgment": "Yes",
        "Confidence": "95%",
        "Reason": "The existing information is sufficient to determine the truthfulness of the claim that Arthur Roberts has been acting as Joe Biden’s body double. Multiple credible sources, including Snopes, have explicitly stated that this claim is 'pure nonsense' and lacks any evidence. Additionally, a TikTok video featuring a prominent figure dismisses the notion as 'just crazy,' which aligns with Snopes' conclusions. The clear and consistent messaging from these credible sources reinforces the position that the body double theory is unfounded, leading to a high confidence level in the assessment of 95%."

    "Final_Judgement": {
        "Answer": "False",
        "Reasons": "The claim that Arthur Roberts has been acting as U.S. President Joe Biden’s body double is false. There is no credible evidence supporting this assertion. Sources such as Snopes have thoroughly debunked the rumor, labeling it as 'pure nonsense' and providing a strong counter-argument against the conspiracy theory. Furthermore, public figures have publicly dismissed the narrative, emphasizing its absurdity in various formats, including social media posts and TikTok videos. Snopes has consistently reiterated their stance on social media, underlining that there is no evidence for these claims. Therefore, the combination of reputable fact-checking, public dismissal of the rumor, and lack of evidence strongly indicates that the claim is baseless.",
