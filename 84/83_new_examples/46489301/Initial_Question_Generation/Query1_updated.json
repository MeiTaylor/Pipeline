The company operating the cargo ship, K Line, was quoted by the Reuters news agency Friday as saying almost 500 of the vehicles on the stricken vessel, the Freemantle Highway car carrier, were battery electric vehicles (EVs).\nThe Dutch coast guard said Thursday that the cause of the fire was unclear and that only about 25 of the vehicles on the ship were EVs, but in the audio of an emergency call released by Dutch broadcaster RTL, someone can be heard saying \"the fire started in the battery of an electric car.\"\nCBS News was unable to reach anyone in K Line's offices in London or the Netherlands on Friday who would comment on the ship.\n!\nAn aerial photograph shows emergency boats extinguishing a fire aboard the Panamanian-registered car carrier cargo ship Fremantle Highway, off the coast of the northern Dutch island of Ameland. FLYING FOCUS/ANP/AFP/Getty\nAccording to an unnamed K Line spokesperson in Tokyo quoted by Reuters, there were 3,783 vehicles on the Freemantle Highway, including 498 EVs. The spokesperson did not give Reuters any information about the make of the vehicles on the ship.\nThe coast guard said it was working to save the vessel from sinking close to an important habitat for migratory birds. Boats and helicopters were used to get the 23 crew members off the ship after they tried unsuccessfully to put out the blaze, the...[Content truncated]",

Anderson Valley Fire Chief Andres Avila provided details on the incident, noting that the initial dispatch came in at 4:54 a.m. \u201cUpon arrival, we found a Tesla fully involved in flames, with the driver already outside the vehicle,\u201d said Avila. The driver, who sustained leg and back injuries, was given medical care and flown to a nearby trauma center.\nThe fire posed unique challenges to the Anderson Valley firefighters due to the nature of electric vehicle (EV) batteries. \u201cThe batteries are very difficult to extinguish because of the way they break down and the challenges in cooling them,\u201d Avila explained.\nEV fires are caused by cell rupture and thermal runaway, where lithium-ion cells react violently to air and water, potentially causing explosive reactions. This can lead to a chain reaction, with multiple cells igniting at different rates, making it hard for firefighters to determine when the fire is fully extinguished.\nThe environmental impact is also significant, as EV battery fires require enormous amounts of water to control\u2014up to 28,000 gallons, compared to just 300 gallons for petrol fires, according to\u00a0.\nFirefighters used special tools to mitigate these challenges, including devices that slide under the vehicle to cool the batteries and blankets to smother the flames. Despite the difficulty, the fire was controlled and did not spread to the wildland.\nThe response required coordination with Caltrans to clear the roadway. \u201cWe had a hard closure and used a loader to move the vehicle off the road, enabling one-way traffic control,\u201d Avila noted. The scene was declared clear by 8:08 a.m., allowing normal traffic to...[Content truncated]",
