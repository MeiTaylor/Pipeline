It is therefore important to determine their size and assess how numerous they are. A technique to investigate the size-frequency distribution of NEOs is the so-called Lunar Monitoring Method. This method is based on observations and detections of faint light flashes on the Moon’s surface caused by NEO impacts.\nRecently, the ESA-funded lunar monitoring project “NELIOTA”(1) (NEO Lunar Impacts and Optical TrAnsients), which features two Zyla 5.5 sCMOS cameras from Andor, an Oxford Instruments company, reported the successful detection of 31 NEO impact flashes in the project’s first year of observations(2). To date, the number of detected NEO impacts increased to 55. The monitoring campaign, now being extended to January 2021, has been performing observations since February 2017 with the recently updated and ground-based 1.2m Kryoneri telescope of the National Observatory of Athens (NOA).\nNELIOTA is the first project to use a 1 meter class telescope for lunar observations, capable of detecting impact flashes about 2 magnitudes fainter than other smaller-aperture monitoring telescopes. In addition, the telescope’s twin camera system called “Lunar imager” offers simultaneous observations of the Moon’s surface in two optical photometric bands, allowing researchers to determine the temperature of each impact flash(3). Furthermore, NELIOTA is...[Content truncated]",

It aims to determine the distribution and frequency of small NEOs (Near-Earth Objects) by monitoring lunar impact flashes. The NELIOTA project has established an operational system that started monitoring the Moon for faint NEO impacts in early 2017, using the 1.2 m , located in the Northern Peloponnese, in Greece. The NELIOTA campaign will run until January 2021. \nThe Kryoneri telescope was upgraded for the project in 2016. Specialized fast-frame cameras were installed and specialized software was developed to control the telescope and cameras, as well as process the resulting images to detect the impacts automatically. NELIOTA furthermore provides a web-based user interface, where the impact events are reported and made available to the scientific community and the general public.\nThe 1.2 m Kryoneri telescope is capable of detecting flashes much fainter than current, small-aperture, lunar monitoring telescopes. NELIOTA is therefore expected to characterize the frequency and distribution of NEOs weighing as little as a few grams.\nTelescope\n---------\nThe 1.2 m Kryoneri telescope at Kryoneri Observatory (established in 1972), located in the district of Corinth in the northern Peloponnese, was selected...[Content truncated]",

NASA said it packed the explosive equivalent of five tons of TNT.  \nCooke believes the lunar impact might have been part of a much larger event.  \n\"On the night of March 17, NASA and University of Western Ontario all-sky cameras picked up an unusual number of deep-penetrating meteors right here on Earth,\" he said. \"These fireballs were traveling along nearly identical orbits between Earth and the asteroid belt.\"  \nThe blast on the moon was so bright that anyone looking at Earth’s closest neighbor at the time of impact could have seen the explosion without a telescope.  \nNASA plans to investigate the impact site with Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter the next time the spacecraft passes over the site. NASA says the crater could be as wide as 20 meters.  \nSince the Moon lacks an atmosphere, meteors crash onto the lunar surface with frequency. NASA said more than half of all lunar meteors come from known meteoroid streams such as the Perseid and Leonid meteor showers.  \nHundreds of detectable lunar impacts occur every year, NASA said.  \n**Here's a video about the explosion:**  \n*   ]\n    #### \n    The Voice of America provides news and...[Content truncated]",

The techniques and technology are similar to observing lunar meteors, except instead of using a focal reducer to widen the field, use a 2x or 3x barlow lens (as seeing allows) to enlarge the image of Venus (which narrows the field) at moderate to high magnification.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI came across an article in the March 2023 issue of Sky and Telescope (pp. 52-53).

Among the selected instruments was the Lunar Environment Monitoring Station (LEMS), a seismometer package developed by a team of researchers including Nicholas Schmerr, an associate professor of geology at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD). Once installed near the lunar south pole, LEMS will collect valuable seismic data about the lunar environment and its interior, which will help prepare NASA to establish a long term presence on other planetary bodies.\n“Our primary goal is to have the mission record moonquakes and characterize the moon’s seismicity,” explained Schmerr, who was also named deputy principal investigator of the LEMS project. “This means being patient and listening for moonquakes, which can be caused by things like impacts hitting the moon or internal quaking from deep inside the lunar interior. With enough seismic events, we’ll be able to use our tools to study the moon’s deeper structure.”\n\nTeam members during final preparation of the LEMS Engineering Units for thermal-vacuum testing. During this test, the LEMS prototype was subjected to the vacuum and harsh thermal conditions that mimic the lunar surface to demonstrate its resilience and ability to sustain itself.

In the framework of this project, here we present all necessary methods to automatically identify these luminous events, their lunar impact coordinates, the origin of the impacting , as well as the estimation of their physical properties such as mass and size. We tested our methods against confirmed impact events and constructed the meteoroid size frequency distribution of impactors using literature data of the last 20 years. In addition, we present the first lunar impact event observed from the Observatoire de la Côte d’Azur that was detected during the testing phase of our project.\nIntroduction\n------------\nImpact cratering is a fundamental process, altering planetary surfaces. Currently we have reached a level where we observe and study impact craters on a plethora of solar system bodies such as planets, moons, asteroids (Marchi et al, 2012, 2015; Sugita et al., 2019; Walsh et al., 2019), Kuiper-belt objects (Singer et al., 2019) and comet nuclei (Vincent et al., 2015). Cratering has been used, together with the knowledge of the size frequency distribution of potential impactors for a given collisional environment, in order to date planetary surfaces based on the simple idea that old surfaces have accumulated more impact craters than more recent ones. This started more than 50 years ago with the Moon (Baldwin, 1971) and was later used to study the chronology on other planetary surfaces such as Mercury (Neukum et al., 2001...[Content truncated]",
