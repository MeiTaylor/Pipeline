However, previous ML works almost all used a single type of lunar map, such as an elevation map (DEM) or orthographic projection map (WAC), to extract crater features; the two types of images have individual limitations on reflecting the crater features, which lead to insufficient feature information, in turn influencing the detection performance. To address this limitation, we, in this work, propose feature complementary of the two types of images and accordingly explore an advanced dual-path convolutional neural network (Dual-Path) based on a U-NET structure to effectively conduct feature integration. Dual-Path consists of a contracting path, bridging path, and expanding path. The contracting path separately extracts features from DEM and WAC images by means of two independent input branches, while the bridging layer integrates the two types of features by 1 \u00d7 1 convo",

In the Minor Planet Center database1, the vast majority of NEOs are classified as Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs), while only a small fraction are classified as Near-Earth Comets (NECs). Both types of minor bodies (NEAs and NECs) are remnant debris of the solar system formation and contain clues that can contribute to the understanding of the composition of planets. The relatively easier accessibility of NEOs, when compared to deep-space asteroids, represents a valuable opportunity to improve the understanding of the solar system at an affordable cost.\nImpacts due to Near-Earth Objects could cause a devastating humanitarian crisis and potentially the extinction of the human race.

This crater catalog is the most up-to-date one in terms of the sizes and number of craters it contains. However, it does not include three-dimensional (3D) morphometric information of crater morphology, such as crater depth, rim height, and wall slope, yet such information is essential for understanding various planetary processes, including terrain properties and impact cratering processes. Thus, it is important to generate a global crater catalog that covers craters of smaller sizes while providing morphometric information of the craters.\nPast efforts to extract 3D morphometric information of craters have focused on local regions on the Moon. Global attempts to derive the 3D morphometric information of craters as small as 1\u00a0km in diameter have seldom be attempted due to the lack of high-resolution data and the amount of effort needed. Recent lunar missions, such as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) (Smith et\u00a0al.,\u00a0), Chang' E-2 (Li et\u00a0al.,\u00a0), and the Selenological and Engineering Explorer (SELENE) (Kato et\u00a0al.,\u00a0), collected higher resolution remote-sensing data sets that include orbital images and laser altimetry data, which offer opportunities to investigate relatively smaller craters while providing more precise morphometric information.\nIn this study, we first present an effective approach for the automated detection of craters and extraction of their 3D morphometric information. The approaches we developed were used to generate a global catalog of lunar craters, LU1319373, that, contains \u223c1.32 million craters with diameters of \u22651\u00a0km while providing 3D morphometric information. Based on this crater catalog, we present a global analysis of craters in terms of spatial density, saturation, and depth-to-diameter ratios, and discuss the implications of these analyses.\n2 Related Works\n---------------\n### 2.1 Crater Detection Methods\nLunar craters have typically been detected from lunar surface images and/or digital elevation models (DEMs) via manual digitization (e.g., Head et\u00a0al.,\u00a0; Robbins,\u00a0) or computer-assisted methods (e.g., Luo et\u00a0al.,\u00a0; Salamuni\u0107car, Lon\u010dari\u0107, Grumpe, & W\u00f6hler,\u00a0).

Scientists study craters on planets, asteroids and moons to learn about the geological history of those bodies. The Apollo lunar missions opened our eyes to the changing rate of impacts throughout the history of the Solar System.\nKnowledge of the ages of lunar craters opened a path for investigating other planetary surfaces. Today, scientists can make inferences about the geologic histories of...[Content truncated]",

Evidence suggests that the likelihood of pandemics has increased over the past century because of increased global travel and integration, urbanization, changes in land use, and greater exploitation of the natural environment (Jones and others 2008; Morse 1995). These trends likely will continue and will intensify. Significant policy attention has focused on the need to identify and limit emerging outbreaks that might lead to pandemics and to expand and sustain investment to build preparedness and health capacity (Smolinsky, Hamburg, and Lederberg 2003).",

These trends likely will continue and will intensify. Significant policy attention has focused on the need to identify and limit emerging outbreaks that might lead to pandemics and to expand and sustain investment to build preparedness and health capacity ().\nThe international community has made progress toward preparing for and mitigating the impacts of pandemics. The 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic and growing concerns about the threat posed by avian influenza led many countries to devise pandemic plans (). Delayed reporting of early SARS cases also led the World Health Assembly to update the International Health Regulations (IHR) to compel all World Health Organization member states to meet specific standards for detecting, reporting on, and responding to outbreaks (). The framework put into place by the updated IHR contributed to a more coordinated global response during the 2009 influenza pandemic (). International donors also have begun to invest in improving preparedness through refined standards and funding for building health capacity ().\nDespite these improvements, significant gaps and challenges exist in global pandemic preparedness. Progress toward meeting the IHR has been uneven, and many countries have been unable to meet basic requirements for compliance (; ). Multiple outbreaks, notably the 2014 West Africa Ebola epidemic, have exposed gaps related to the timely detection of disease, availability of basic care, tracing of contacts, quarantine and isolation procedures, and preparedness outside the health sector, including global coordination and response mobilization (; ). These gaps are especially evident in resource-limited settings and have posed challenges during relatively localized epidemics, with dire implications for what may happen during a full-fledged global pandemic.\nFor the purposes of this chapter, an _epidemic_ is defined as \u201cthe occurrence in a community or region of cases of an illness . . . clearly in excess of normal expectancy\u201d (). A _pandemic_ is defined as \u201can epidemic occurring over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries, and usually affecting a large number of people\u201d (). Pandemics are, therefore, identified by their geographic scale rather than the severity of illness. For example, in contrast to annual seasonal influenza epidemics, _pandemic influenza_ is defined as \u201cwhen a new influenza virus emerges and spreads around the world, and most people do not have immunity\u201d ().\nThis chapter does not consider endemic diseases\u2014those that are constantly present in particular localities or regions. Endemic diseases are far more common than pandemics and can have significant negative health and economic impacts, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with weak health systems.

Costs associated with fraud are passed on to the population in the form of increased premiums or serious harm to beneficiaries. There is an intense need for digital healthcare fraud detection systems to evolve in combating this societal threat. Due to the complex, heterogenic data systems and varied health models across the US, implementing digital advancements in healthcare is difficult. The end goal of healthcare fraud detection is to provide leads to the investigators that can then be inspected more closely with the possibility of recoupments, recoveries, or referrals to the appropriate authorities or agencies. In this article, healthcare fraud detection systems and methods found in the literature are described and summarized. A tabulated list of peer-reviewed articles in this research domain listing the main objectives, conclusions, and data characteristics is provided. The potential gaps identified in the implementation of such systems to real-world healthcare data will be discussed. The authors propose several research topics to fill these gaps for future researchers in this domain.\n**Keywords:** Medicaid, fraud detection, class imbalance, machine learning, health insurance claims\nHealthcare Fraud Introduction\n-----------------------------\n### Background and Significance\nCaring for health has become more expensive, making both private and public administrators more cost conscious in recent years. Therefore, health decision-makers are actively looking for ways to reduce costs. One such avenue of saving potentially billions of dollars is to avoid and detect healthcare fraud. The National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association conservatively estimates that about 3 percent of our healthcare spending is lost to fraud ($300 billion approximately) yearly. Fraud is a complex and difficult problem. It is important to acknowledge that fraud schemes constantly evolve, and fraudsters adapt their methods accordingly. The earliest account of \u201cfraud\u201d in the healthcare literature is from the 1860s when railway collisions were a frequent occurrence, leading to a controversial condition called \u201crailway spine,\u201d which later became a leading cause of personal injury compensation in rail accidents. These accidental events were made profitable by means of insurance settlements in-court or out-of-court by opportunistic claimants, and these events laid the groundwork for fraud definitions and fraud management in the...[Content truncated]",
