Traditional crater identification methods struggle with accuracy because of the diverse forms, locations, and sizes of the craters. Our main aim is to locate lunar craters using images from Terrain Mapping Camera-2 (TMC-2) onboard the Chandrayaan-II satellite. The crater-based U-Net model, a convolutional neural network frequently used in image segmentation tasks, is a deep learning method presented in this study. The task of crater detection was accomplished with the proposed model in two steps: initially, it was trained using Resnet18 as the backbone and U-Net based on Image Net as weights. Secondly, TMC-2 images from Chandrayaan-2 were used to detect craters based on the trained model. The model proposed in this study comprises a neural network, feature extractor, and optimization technique for lunar crater detection. The model achieves 80.95% accuracy using unannotated data and precision and recall are much better with annotated data with an accuracy of 86.91% in object detection with TMC-2 ortho images. 2000 images have been considered for the present work as manual annotation is a time-consuming process and the inclusion of more images...[Content truncated]",

This crater catalog is the most up-to-date one in terms of the sizes and number of craters it contains. However, it does not include three-dimensional (3D) morphometric information of crater morphology, such as crater depth, rim height, and wall slope, yet such information is essential for understanding various planetary processes, including terrain properties and impact cratering processes. Thus, it is important to generate a global crater catalog that covers craters of smaller sizes while providing morphometric information of the craters.\nPast efforts to extract 3D morphometric information of craters have focused on local regions on the Moon. Global attempts to derive the 3D morphometric information of craters as small as 1 km in diameter have seldom be attempted due to the lack of high-resolution data and the amount of effort needed. Recent lunar missions, such as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) (Smith et al., ), Chang' E-2 (Li et al., ), and the Selenological and Engineering Explorer (SELENE) (Kato et al., ), collected higher resolution remote-sensing data sets that include orbital images and laser altimetry data, which offer opportunities to investigate relatively smaller craters while providing more precise morphometric information.\nIn this study, we first present an effective approach for the automated detection of craters and extraction of their 3D morphometric information. The approaches we developed were used to generate a global catalog of lunar craters, LU1319373, that, contains ∼1.32 million craters with diameters of ≥1 km while providing 3D morphometric information. Based on this crater catalog, we present a global analysis of craters in terms of spatial density, saturation, and depth-to-diameter ratios, and discuss the implications of these analyses.\n2 Related Works\n---------------\n### 2.1 Crater Detection Methods\nLunar craters have typically been detected from lunar surface images and/or digital elevation models (DEMs) via manual digitization (e.g., Head et al., ; Robbins, ) or computer-assisted methods (e.g., Luo et al., ; Salamunićcar, Lončarić, Grumpe, & Wöhler, ).

In the framework of this project, here we present all necessary methods to automatically identify these luminous events, their lunar impact coordinates, the origin of the impacting , as well as the estimation of their physical properties such as mass and size. We tested our methods against confirmed impact events and constructed the meteoroid size frequency distribution of impactors using literature data of the last 20 years. In addition, we present the first lunar impact event observed from the Observatoire de la Côte d’Azur that was detected during the testing phase of our project.\nIntroduction\n------------\nImpact cratering is a fundamental process, altering planetary surfaces. Currently we have reached a level where we observe and study impact craters on a plethora of solar system bodies such as planets, moons, asteroids (Marchi et al, 2012, 2015; Sugita et al., 2019; Walsh et al., 2019), Kuiper-belt objects (Singer et al., 2019) and comet nuclei (Vincent et al., 2015). Cratering has been used, together with the knowledge of the size frequency distribution of potential impactors for a given collisional environment, in order to date planetary surfaces based on the simple idea that old surfaces have accumulated more impact craters than more recent ones. This started more than 50 years ago with the Moon (Baldwin, 1971) and was later used to study the chronology on other planetary surfaces such as Mercury (Neukum et al., 2001...[Content truncated]",

Secondly, TMC-2 images from Chandrayaan-2 were used to detect craters based on the trained model. The model proposed in this study comprises a neural network, feature extractor, and optimization technique for lunar crater detection. The model achieves 80.95% accuracy using unannotated data and precision and recall are much better with annotated data with an accuracy of 86.91% in object detection with TMC-2 ortho images. 2000 images have been considered for the present work as manual annotation is a time-consuming process and the inclusion of more images...[Content truncated]"

            "content": "\nNASA chose the first science instruments designed for astronauts to deploy on the surface of the moon during Artemis III, the agency’s first crewed mission to the lunar surface in over 50 years currently planned for 2026. Among the selected instruments was the Lunar Environment Monitoring Station (LEMS), a seismometer package developed by a team of researchers including Nicholas Schmerr, an associate professor of geology at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD). Once installed near the lunar south pole, LEMS will collect valuable seismic data about the lunar environment and its interior, which will help prepare NASA to establish a long term presence on other planetary bodies.\n“Our primary goal is to have the mission record moonquakes and characterize the moon’s seismicity,” explained Schmerr, who was also named deputy principal investigator of the LEMS project. “This means being patient and listening for moonquakes, which can be caused by things like impacts hitting the moon or internal quaking from deep inside the lunar interior. With enough seismic events, we’ll be able to use our tools to study the moon’s deeper structure.”\n\nTeam members during final preparation of the LEMS Engineering Units for thermal-vacuum testing.

        "Question": "What methods do reputable astronomical institutions use to visually verify lunar impact events?",
        "Answer": "Reputable astronomical institutions utilize several advanced methods to visually verify lunar impact events. Here are the key approaches:\n\n1. **Lunar Impact Monitoring Program**: NASA has established a program that employs Earth-based observations to record impacts on the Moon's surface. This program focuses on the large meteoroids (greater than 10s of grams) that strike the lunar surface, utilizing optimal observation times, such as the dark portion of the Moon and when solar illumination is minimal. This systematic monitoring allows for the accurate establishment of impact rates and sizes over time, enhancing the understanding of the meteoroid environment and its effects on the Moon.\n\n2. **High-Resolution Imaging and Automated Crater Detection**: Institutions like the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) through its Chandrayaan missions utilize high-resolution imaging technology to detect and study impact craters on the Moon. By employing advanced deep learning techniques, such as a convolutional neural network model for automated crater detection, researchers have significantly improved the accuracy of identifying new craters from lunar images. This method involves the analysis of extensive datasets gathered from lunar orbiters to verify the presence and characteristics of craters that result from impact events.\n\n3. **Seismic Monitoring**: Future lunar missions, like NASA's Artemis III, plan to deploy seismic instruments such as the Lunar Environment Monitoring Station (LEMS). These instruments will listen for moonquakes, which may be triggered by impacts on the Moon's surface. By recording seismic activity, researchers can gain insight into the frequency and nature of impacts, contributing to the understanding of lunar geology and the impact history of the Moon. This method combines long-term monitoring of lunar seismicity with geophysical observations.\n\nOverall, these methods integrate observational data, automated analysis, and seismic monitoring to establish a comprehensive approach for visually verifying lunar impact events.",
