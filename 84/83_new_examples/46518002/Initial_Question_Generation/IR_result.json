However, ancient meteoroid impacts and their relations to environmental changes are not well understood because of erosion and/or resurfacing processes on Earth. Here, we investigate the formation ages of 59 lunar craters with fresh morphologies and diameters greater than approximately 20 km and first find that 8 of 59 craters were formed simultaneously. Considering the radiometric ages of ejecta from Copernicus crater and impact glass spherules from various Apollo landing sites, we conclude that sporadic meteoroid bombardment occurred across the whole Moon at approximately 800 Ma. Based on crater scaling laws and collision probabilities with the Earth and Moon, we suggest that at least (4–5) × 1016 kg of meteoroids, approximately 30–60 times more than the Chicxulub impact, must have plunged into the Earth-Moon system immediately before the Cryogenian, which was an era of great environmental changes.\nUnderstanding meteoroid bombardment of the Earth system is an issue of both great scientific interest and practical importance because impacts are potentially hazardous to the Earth.

One turned out to have a little moon orbiting it, while the other had been discovered only 13 days before its closest approach to Earth. There was no risk of either near-Earth object impacting our planet, but the radar observations taken during these two close approaches will provide valuable practice for planetary defense, as well as information about their sizes, orbits, rotation, surface details, and clues as to their composition and formation.\nPassing Earth on June 27 at a distance of 4.1 million miles (6.6 million kilometers), or about 17 times the distance between the Moon and Earth, the asteroid 2011 UL21 was discovered in 2011 by the NASA-funded Catalina Sky Survey, in Tucson, Arizona. But this is the first time it has come close enough to Earth to be imaged by radar. While the nearly mile-wide (1.5-kilometer-wide) object is classified as being potentially hazardous, calculations of its future orbits show that it won’t pose a threat to our planet for the foreseeable future.\nThese seven radar observations by the Deep Space Network’s Goldstone Solar System Radar shows the mile-wide asteroid 2011 UL21 during its June 27 close approach with Earth from about 4 million miles away. The asteroid and its small moon (a bright dot at the bottom of the image) are circled in white.\nUsing the Deep Space Network’s 230-foot-wide (70-meter) Goldstone Solar System Radar, called Deep Space Station 14 (DSS-14), near Barstow, California, JPL scientists transmitted radio waves to the asteroid and received the reflected signals by the same antenna. In addition to determining the asteroid is roughly spherical, they discovered that it’s a binary system: A smaller asteroid, or moonlet, orbits it from a distance of about 1.9 miles (3 kilometers).\nNews from Infinity and Beyond\n“It is thought that about two-thirds of asteroids of this size are binary systems, and their discovery is particularly important because we can use measurements of their relative positions to estimate their mutual orbits, masses, and densities, which provide key information about how they may have formed,” said Lance Benner, principal scientist at JPL who helped lead the observations.\nAssembled into this animation, observations from NASA’s Goldstone Solar System Radar show...[Content truncated]",

Local eyewitnesses in the sparsely populated region reported seeing a fireball and hearing a large explosion. They also reported massive forest fires, and trees blown over for miles. Because of the remoteness of the site, the event garnered little attention even within Tsarist Russia and much less outside. The first scientific expedition did not reach the area until 1927, but still found ample evidence of the asteroid’s destruction caused by the shock wave and heat blast from the aerial explosion. Archaeologists have found evidence of similar events in the past, and smaller asteroids regularly break up in the atmosphere causing little or no damage. NASA established the Planetary Defense Coordination Office and during the DART mission tested the technology to redirect a small asteroid should one pose a danger to Earth in the future.\n!\n_Modern map of Russia, showing the location of the 1908 Tunguska event._\n_**Wikipedia**_\n!\n_Schematic map of the Tunguska site, showing  \nthe epicenter located beneath the blast, and the areas of burned and flattened trees._\n_**Christopher O.

However, ancient meteoroid impacts and their relations to environmental changes are not well understood because of erosion and/or resurfacing processes on Earth. Here, we investigate the formation ages of 59 lunar craters with fresh morphologies and diameters greater than approximately 20 km and first find that 8 of 59 craters were formed simultaneously. Considering the radiometric ages of ejecta from Copernicus crater and impact glass spherules from various Apollo landing sites, we conclude that sporadic meteoroid bombardment occurred across the whole Moon at approximately 800 Ma. Based on crater scaling laws and collision probabilities with the Earth and Moon, we suggest that at least (4–5) × 1016 kg of meteoroids, approximately 30–60 times more than the Chicxulub impact, must have plunged into the Earth-Moon system immediately before the Cryogenian, which was an era of great environmental changes.\nUnderstanding meteoroid bombardment of the Earth system is an issue of both great scientific interest and practical importance because impacts are potentially hazardous to the Earth. Since the 541 Ma Cambrian biodiversity explosion, mass extinction events have occurred at least five times (the so-called Big five events)1, and extra-ter...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "Is there credible evidence verifying that an asteroid impact and explosion occurred on the Moon's surface?",
        "Answer": "There is credible evidence verifying that asteroid impacts, including explosions, have occurred on the Moon's surface. Here are several key points supporting this conclusion:\n\n1. **Lunar Geological History**: The Moon's surface is extensively marked by craters, formed by impacts from meteoroids, asteroids, and comets over billions of years. The presence of these craters, which are dominant landforms on the Moon, serves as direct evidence of its history of impact events. Many of these impacts have had significant physical consequences, influencing the geological landscape of the Moon and contributing to its characterization as a body shaped by violent collisions.\n\n2. **Apollo Mission Findings**: Between 1969 and 1972, six Apollo missions returned a plethora of lunar samples, which include rocks and soils formed by impact events. Studies of these samples have provided insights into the early history of the Moon and have confirmed that impact events have possibly contributed to its formation and surface composition. The presence of impact-generated glass in lunar rocks further corroborates evidence of significant impacts having occurred on the Moon's surface.\n\n3. **Research on Ancient Impacts**: Recent studies have investigated the ages and effects of meteoroid bombardment on the Moon. One study identified 59 lunar craters with morphologies indicating recent formation, concluding that meteoroid impacts have occurred across the Moon and have played a crucial role in its geological history. This indicates that substantial impacts have not only occurred in the past but also that the frequency of these events might be higher than previously understood.\n\nGiven the consistent findings from lunar geology, the analysis of Apollo samples, and the research on ancient impacts, we have robust evidence supporting the occurrence of impacts on the Moon. Therefore, we can confidently assert that there is credible evidence verifying that asteroid impacts and explosions have indeed occurred on the Moon's surface.",
