The dashboard displays the date of closest approach, approximate object diameter, relative size and distance from Earth for each encounter. The object's name is displayed by hovering over its encounter date. Clicking on the encounter date will display a Web page with details about that object.\nThe dashboard displays the next five Earth approaches to within 4.6 million miles (7.5 million kilometers or 19.5 times the distance to the moon); an object larger than about 150 meters that can approach the Earth to within this distance is termed a potentially hazardous object.\nThe average distance between Earth and the moon is about 239,000 miles (385,000 kilometers).\n### Find Out More\nAsteroid Watch home page\nAbout JPL\nMissions\nNews\nGalleries\nEvents\nVisit\nTopics\nMore\nGet the Latest from JPL\nFollow Us\nJPL is a federally funded research and development center managed for NASA by Caltech.\nMore from JPL\nRelated NASA Sites\nSite Managers: Veronica McGregor, Randal Jackson\nSite Editors: Tony Greicius, Naomi Hartono\n...[Content truncated]",

Local eyewitnesses in the sparsely populated region reported seeing a fireball and hearing a large explosion. They also reported massive forest fires, and trees blown over for miles. Because of the remoteness of the site, the event garnered little attention even within Tsarist Russia and much less outside. The first scientific expedition did not reach the area until 1927, but still found ample evidence of the asteroid’s destruction caused by the shock wave and heat blast from the aerial explosion. Archaeologists have found evidence of similar events in the past, and smaller asteroids regularly break up in the atmosphere causing little or no damage. NASA established the Planetary Defense Coordination Office and during the DART mission tested the technology to redirect a small asteroid should one pose a danger to Earth in the future.\n!\n_Modern map of Russia, showing the location of the 1908 Tunguska event._\n_**Wikipedia**_\n!\n_Schematic map of the Tunguska site, showing  \nthe epicenter located beneath the blast, and the areas of burned and flattened trees._\n_**Christopher O.

One turned out to have a little moon orbiting it, while the other had been discovered only 13 days before its closest approach to Earth. There was no risk of either near-Earth object impacting our planet, but the radar observations taken during these two close approaches will provide valuable practice for planetary defense, as well as information about their sizes, orbits, rotation, surface details, and clues as to their composition and formation.\nPassing Earth on June 27 at a distance of 4.1 million miles (6.6 million kilometers), or about 17 times the distance between the Moon and Earth, the asteroid 2011 UL21 was discovered in 2011 by the NASA-funded Catalina Sky Survey, in Tucson, Arizona. But this is the first time it has come close enough to Earth to be imaged by radar. While the nearly mile-wide (1.5-kilometer-wide) object is classified as being potentially hazardous, calculations of its future orbits show that it won’t pose a threat to our planet for the foreseeable future.\nThese seven radar observations by the Deep Space Network’s Goldstone Solar System Radar shows the mile-wide asteroid 2011 UL21 during its June 27 close approach with Earth from about 4 million miles away. The asteroid and its small moon (a bright dot at the bottom of the image) are circled in white.\nUsing the Deep Space Network’s 230-foot-wide (70-meter) Goldstone Solar System Radar, called Deep Space Station 14 (DSS-14), near Barstow, California, JPL scientists transmitted radio waves to the asteroid and received the reflected signals by the same antenna. In addition to determining the asteroid is roughly spherical, they discovered that it’s a binary system: A smaller asteroid, or moonlet, orbits it from a distance of about 1.9 miles (3 kilometers).\nNews from Infinity and Beyond\n“It is thought that about two-thirds of asteroids of this size are binary systems, and their discovery is particularly important because we can use measurements of their relative positions to estimate their mutual orbits, masses, and densities, which provide key information about how they may have formed,” said Lance Benner, principal scientist at JPL who helped lead the observations.\nAssembled into this animation, observations from NASA’s Goldstone Solar System Radar show...[Content truncated]",

But it doesn't hold up under scientific scrutiny, said Paul Withers of the UA Lunar and Planetary Laboratory.\nSuch an impact would have resulted in a blinding, blizzard-like, week-long meteor storm on Earth - yet there are no such accounts in any known historical record, including the European, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese and Korean astronomical archives, Withers said. He reports the analysis and other tests of the hypothesis in this month's issue of Meteoritics and Planetary Science.\nThe dramatic passage in question appears in the medieval chronicles of Gervase of Canterbury.\nAbout an hour after sunset June 18, 1178 A.D., a band of five eyewitnesses watched as the upper horn...[Content truncated]",
