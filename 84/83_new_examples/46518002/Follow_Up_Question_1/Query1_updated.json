He said, \u201cThis is obviously just an edit, but explosions from impacts on the moon happen a lot. The rocket that hit it recently left a double crater.\u201d\nResponding to another user, Sinclair said, \u201cNASA has been sharing videos of impacts exploding on the moon for years. A Japanese scientist Daichi Fugii recently recorded some explosions from impacts on the moon too.\u201d\nAccording to the , Daichi Fuji who is head of astronomy at the Hiratsuka City Museum, had reportedly captured the biggest lunar impact flash from his home in Hiratsuka, Japan.\nSince the creator of the videos, Sinclair has clarified in the comments that he has edited the video, we conclude that the video is computer-generated.

A widespread reaction to the video was the question, \"Is this real?\"\n> Is this real???? \n> \n> \u2014 Kristi Yamaguccimane (@TheWapplehouse) \nThe answer to that question was \"No.\" The video was computer generated. As  by India Today's fact checking department, the video was  to YouTube by user Diego Sinclair in February 2023. His channel contains several other videos of often unrealistic looking space phenomena. In the comments section of that video, Sinclair wrote that it was an edited video:\n> This is obviously just an edit, but explosions from impacts on the moon happen a lot.\nIt is true that objects colliding with the moon create bright flashes of light that are, in some cases, bright enough  to the naked eye from Earth. However, these events are not bright due to fire or combustion of any kind \u2014 as depicted in the faked video. Such a cascading fireball would require oxygen, which the Moon lacks. Instead, as explained by NASA, the bright flashes of light  by molten rock:\n> The Moon has no oxygen atmosphere, so how can something explode? Lunar meteors don't require oxygen or combustion to make themselves visible.\u00a0 They hit the ground with so much kinetic energy that even a pebble can make a crater several feet wide.\u00a0 The flash of light comes not from combustion but rather from the thermal glow of molten rock and hot vapors at the impact site.\nSuch events are fairly common, and have indeed been captured  several times:\n> \nBecause the author of the viral impact video has stated that it was \"an edit,\" Snopes rates this video as Fake.\n...[Content truncated]",
