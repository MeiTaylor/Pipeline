Conspiracy theories about the event dating back to the 1970s are in fact more popular than ever. A common theory is that film director Stanley Kubrick helped NASA fake the historic footage of its six successful moon landings.\nBut would it really have been possible to do that with the technology available at the time? \nI’m not a space travel expert, an engineer or a scientist. I am a filmmaker and lecturer in film post-production, and – while I can’t say how we landed on the moon in 1969 – I can say with some certainty that the footage would have been impossible to fake.\nHere are some of the most common beliefs and questions – and why they don’t hold up.\nThere are two different ways of capturing moving images. One is film, actual strips of photographic material onto which a series of images are exposed. Another is video, which is an electronic method of recording onto various mediums, such as moving magnetic tape. With video, you can also broadcast to a television receiver. A standard motion picture film records images at 24 frames per second, while broadcast television is typically either 25 or 30 frames, depending on where you are in the world.\nREAD MORE: How many people does it take to keep a conspiracy alive?\nIf we go along with the idea that the moon landings were taped in a TV studio, then we would expect them to be 30 frames per second video, which...[Content truncated]",

        "Question": "Is there any expert analysis confirming whether the explosion in the video was created using CGI or actual footage?",
        "Answer": "The explosion depicted in the video claiming to show an asteroid hitting the Moon was created using CGI and not actual footage. Here are the reasons supporting this conclusion: 1. **Expert Confirmation of CGI**: A fact-check report specifically states that the video is a computer-generated imagery (CGI) creation and does not represent real footage of an asteroid impacting the Moon. The report indicates that the claim about the video showing an actual impact is false, as corroborated by reverse image searches and confirmations from the creator of the video who described it as an edited video [Query1_evidence_1]. 2. **Lack of Recent Impact Footage**: While it is true that meteoroids do impact the Moon and these events can sometimes be observed, there has been no credible recent footage confirming an asteroid impact similar to what is portrayed in the video. In fact, NASA has a program that monitors lunar impacts, but the video in question does not align with any real events captured by these programs [Query1_evidence_2]. 3. **Actual Impact Recordings**: Previous instances of lunar impacts, such as one captured by astronomer Daichi Fujii in February 2023, demonstrate that while impacts can create observable phenomena (like brief flashes), these are recorded by actual observational equipment and are not CGI [Query1_evidence_3]. The nature of the reported explosion in the video starkly contrasts with real footage from documented lunar impacts.",
