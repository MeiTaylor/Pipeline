Conspiracy theories about the event dating back to the 1970s are in fact more popular than ever. A common theory is that film director Stanley Kubrick helped NASA fake the historic footage of its six successful moon landings.\nBut would it really have been possible to do that with the technology available at the time? \nI’m not a space travel expert, an engineer or a scientist. I am a filmmaker and lecturer in film post-production, and – while I can’t say how we landed on the moon in 1969 – I can say with some certainty that the footage would have been impossible to fake.\nHere are some of the most common beliefs and questions – and why they don’t hold up.\nThere are two different ways of capturing moving images. One is film, actual strips of photographic material onto which a series of images are exposed. Another is video, which is an electronic method of recording onto various mediums, such as moving magnetic tape. With video, you can also broadcast to a television receiver. A standard motion picture film records images at 24 frames per second, while broadcast television is typically either 25 or 30 frames, depending on where you are in the world.\nREAD MORE: How many people does it take to keep a conspiracy alive?\nIf we go along with the idea that the moon landings were taped in a TV studio, then we would expect them to be 30 frames per second video, which...[Content truncated]",

Enjoy.\n### Accents\n#### Wired’s Technique Critique: Accents\nI think this is the video that kind of started the genre, it has more than 6 million views, and it’s among the best: Erik Singer, a dialect coach, goes through various performances in movies and not only says whether the accents are correct or not, but explains in a detailed but accessible way how the accents are supposed to work. Or in the case of Mickey Rooney’s ridiculous Japanese accent in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, a disgusted dismissal that you can’t help laughing at.\n**Common error:** Though the critiques are about individual actors’ performances, Singer doesn’t blame the actors, chalking up errors to a lack of preparation time, and clarifying that it’s the responsibility of the actors, directors and coaches to ensure they’re done properly.\nSee also:\n*   Episode 2: \n*   Episode 3: \n*   Episode 6: \n### Fighting\n#### Vulture’s Expert Witness: Hollywood sword fights\nFight coordinator and fencing expert Jared Kirby finds the scenes he critiques surprisingly accurate (with one notable exception). But he doesn’t go into much detail about technique, which is unfortunate.\n**Common error:** It’s very easy to defend yourself against a bunch of enemies when most of them are standing around and waiting for their turn to attack you.\n#### GQ: Bow Hunter Breaks Down Bow and Arrow Scenes from Movies & TV\nProfessional bow hunter Cameron Hanes reviews scenes with bows and arrows, going beyond the usual “he’s holding it wrong” and going into how arrows behave in flight and what we should expect when they hit their targets.\n#### BuzzFeed: How Realistic Are Movie Sword Fights?\nRaab Rashi, a sword class instructor, looks at sword fights specifically, and you can tell he enjoys these kinds of scenes in movies. He does a decent job of explaining swordfighting strategy, though the video could better illustrate how they’re doing it wrong.\n**Common error:** Swords used as clubs or bats. They’re sharp things to stab or cut with.\n#### BuzzFeed: MMA Coach Reviews Fight Scenes In Movies\nRene Dreifuss, MMA coach, takes a look at various fight scenes (hand-to-hand combat) and notes that moves that appear very spectacular on film are actually bad fight moves because they do little against your opponent....[Content truncated]",

We work closely with scientists — both within the NASA community, and within the broader academic research community — to create high-quality, data-backed visualizations.\n* * *\nAbout Us\n--------\nNASA Scientific Visualization Studio is based out of the **Goddard Space Flight Center** (**GSFC**), located in Greenbelt, Maryland. The core studio consists of a team of (approximately) 15 visualizers, some of whom have been working with the studio for almost 30 years. The SVS's visualizers specialize in a wide variety of disciplines — astronomy, planetary science, climatology, cartography, and 3D modeling (to name a few) — but are united by a common love of making science accessible.\n### History\nNASA’s Scientific Visualization Studio was founded by **Jim Strong** at the **NASA Goddard Space Flight Center** (**GSFC**) in **1990**. Jim would soon be joined in **1991** by visualizer **Horace Mitchell**, who would go on to head the department all the way until his retirement in **2019**. The studio was originally founded to create visualizations to go alongside NASA research publications – which still constitute the vast majority of the studio’s work to this day. In the studio’s early days, much of our work focused on creating (near...[Content truncated]",
