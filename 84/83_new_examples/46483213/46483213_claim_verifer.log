  "Claim": "On Aug. 18, 2016, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump said, "In my administration, I'm going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information. No one will be above the law."",
  "Video_information": {'video_date': 20230609.0, 'platform': 'twitter', 'video_headline': '"In my administration, I\'m going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information.

No one will be above the law.", 'Video_descriptor': 'The video opens with a man dressed in a suit, speaking into a microphone, setting the tone for a formal political event. Following him, another man, also attired in a suit and tie, takes center stage, continuing to address the audience through the microphone. This pattern persists as he is captured speaking once again while standing proudly in front of an array of American flags, symbolizing the event\'s patriotic context. Throughout the video, key frames underline that the setting is consistent with a live broadcast from a significant political occasion, described as a segment of "Washington Journal Live" scheduled for 7 am ET, indicating its prominence and timely relevance. The logos and captions, including "ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE," further establish the event\'s link to an ongoing political campaign, suggesting that these speeches contribute to a larger narrative leading up to the presidency. As the video draws to a close, it encapsulates this man in the suit and tie, remaining the focal point, delivering a final address into the microphone against the backdrop of flags, effectively concluding a cohesive segment of political discourse filled with determined gesturing and formal presentation, all captured within a narrative that reflects the seriousness and gravity of the political climate being addressed.'},

  "CVResult": {
    "Judgment": "Yes",
    "Confidence": "95%",
    "Reason": "The existing information is sufficient to determine the truthfulness of the claim. The video information clearly contains a direct quote from Donald Trump stating, 'In my administration, I'm going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information. No one will be above the law.' This directly correlates with the claim made about his statement during his campaign on August 18, 2016. The context provided indicates that this statement was made during a significant political event, which adds credibility to the authenticity of the quote. Therefore, we can reasonably conclude that the claim is true based on the evidence presented."
