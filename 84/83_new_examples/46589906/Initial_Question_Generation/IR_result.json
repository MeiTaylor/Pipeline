Is that a feature? As you walk up to the car it automatically starts like magic? I'm not familiar with these newer cars.\nwsh on Dec 5, 2018 | next \nYes, it’s a feature, so you don’t have to remove the key from a bag or pocket to enter or start the car.\nIn typical designs, the car continually transmits a low-frequency (e.g., 135 kHz) radio signal to wake up any wireless keys within range. When a key receives this signal, it replies with a VHF (e.g., 315 MHz) signal, and the car unlocks or starts when a door is opened or the start button is pressed.\nThe reply signal, at least, is uniquely coded to the car. The attack is to extend the range of the LF wake-up signal, causing a key stored away from the car to transmit a valid reply.\nIn some models, besides the transponder described above, the key also has a passive RFID tag, which works with a reader in the car to allow starting even if the battery in the key is dead.\n(The article is wrong about the broadcasts, by the way; if the key transmitted continually, its battery wouldn’t last long.)\nryandrake on Dec 5, 2018 | parent | next \nThis is insane.

Future generations won’t know that we used to use actual keys to unlock and start our cars.\nKey fobs transmit a radio signal to the car and if the car recognizes the transmission as coming from the right fob(s) it will perform the command encoded in the radio transmission.\n**All key fobs of U.S. manufacturers use a radio signal frequency of 315 MHz** and foreign models us 433.92 MHz. Because all fobs use just one of two frequencies, **the security relies on both the fob (transmitter) and car electronics (receiver) knowing the same code which changes after every press of the key fob button** (or otherwise communicating with each other). Both the transmitter and receiver know the code numbers as they change because they are **programmed with the same code generating algorithm.** So, both the car and fob know what code number will be next due to sharing an algorithm.\nThe mathematics of the quasi-randomly generated codes is that it is **about a one-in-a-billion chance that a car would mistakenly unlock** because of a duplicate code transmission from a wrong fob.\n**What happens if you press the key fob button when you aren’t in range of the car?** Now the car receiver and fob transmitter are no longer in sync as the fob will move one code number ahead of the car receiver.

The antenna must be tuned when held in the hand, as your body provides the missing earth or ground-plane.\nYou can easily demonstrate this. Mount an antenna on a ground-plane with a length of coax, a SWR meter and a transmitter. Tune the antenna so the SWR is 1:1 and then move you hand close to the antenna. Once your hand gets withing a wavelength or so, the effect of the \"detuning\" can be readily seen on the SWR meter.\njpk 6 months ago | parent | next \nThis reminds me of a class in college where one project was to make a waveguide WiFi antenna. You know the ones; often built out of a Pringles can.\nOn the day the project was due, we each demo'd our antennas and the instructor recorded their range, SNR, etc. Most in the class followed the Pringles...[Content truncated]"

            "content": " This entry comes to you courtesy of the fact that I’ve heard this maybe-myth told to me more than once in the past few weeks my friends and complete strangers alike. My car’s keyless entry remote, for lack of a better word, sucks. I practically have to be next to the car to get it to work. Alas, plenty of the aforementioned people have given me the tip to hold the remote to my chin with my mouth slightly open to increase the range of the remote signal. Is this just an old tech wives tale, or is there something legit about this voodoo car magic? \n Although it sounds absolutely bonkers when you first hear it (and actually it sounds just as crazy even after you do some research on it), this actually works. And for good reason, too: The oral cavity and fluids in your skull do some kind of crazy wizardry to the remote signal when you’re holding the key fob to your chin. It’s kind of like the reason why those ancient “rabbit ear” TV antennas gave you better reception when you were touching them. \n The New York Times asked a Silicon Valley radio engineer, Tim Pozar, for his take on how the trick turns your head into a DIY antenna. \n If you ask William Van Winkle, it’s a lot more than a few car lengths. He wrote this article for Tom’s Guide earlier this month and totally confirmed that it increased his car’s remote control effectiveness by about twice the length that it was before: \n Great trick! \n The home you love starts here\n The home you love starts here\nMore From Us\nFollow along\nNewsletter\nEnjoy a daily dose of house tours, before & afters, decorating hacks, and more.\n© 2024 Apartment Therapy, LLC / Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyEU and US State Data Subject Requests"

        "Question": "What scientific principles explain why holding a key fob to the head might increase its range?",
        "Answer": "Holding a car's key fob to your head may increase its effective range due to several scientific principles related to how radio signals interact with the human body.\n\n1. **Body as an Antenna**: The human body can function analogously to an antenna due to its conductive properties. When you hold the key fob close to your head, your body enhances the transmission of the signal. This happens because the body can couple with radio frequency (RF) sources capacitively, effectively amplifying the output from the fob's transmitter. The frequency used by car key fobs (around 315 MHz) means the size and shape of the human body can improve the signal due to the body's dimensions being comparable to the wavelength of the signal.\n\n2. **Tuning of the Signal**: It's suggested that key fob transmitters are often optimized to work best when near a human body. The signal the key fob emits is tuned for the presence of a nearby body, which provides a reference ground or 'earth plane' that is necessary for the optimal performance of many antennas. This means that when distancing the key fob from the body, such as when it is held in hand, the signal may be less effective due to detuning.\n\n3. **Amplification Effects**: Holding the key fob at the head introduces a surface that can amplify the signal. The oral cavity and the fluids in your skull can create a resonance effect, somewhat akin to how certain TV antennas work better when physically contacted. Experts liken this to how “rabbit ear” antennas could pick up signals with better reception when touched.\n\nIn summary, the combination of the human body acting as an antenna and the tuning of the key fob's signal for use near the body creates a scenario where simply holding the key fob to the head can effectively increase the operating range of the device.",
