Is that a feature? As you walk up to the car it automatically starts like magic? I'm not familiar with these newer cars.\nwsh on Dec 5, 2018 | next \nYes, it\u2019s a feature, so you don\u2019t have to remove the key from a bag or pocket to enter or start the car.\nIn typical designs, the car continually transmits a low-frequency (e.g., 135 kHz) radio signal to wake up any wireless keys within range. When a key receives this signal, it replies with a VHF (e.g., 315 MHz) signal, and the car unlocks or starts when a door is opened or the start button is pressed.\nThe reply signal, at least, is uniquely coded to the car. The attack is to extend the range of the LF wake-up signal, causing a key stored away from the car to transmit a valid reply.\nIn some models, besides the transponder described above, the key also has a passive RFID tag, which works with a reader in the car to allow starting even if the battery in the key is dead.\n(The article is wrong about the broadcasts, by the way; if the key transmitted continually, its battery wouldn\u2019t last long.)\nryandrake on Dec 5, 2018 | parent | next \nThis is insane. Please tell me this is an option that non-insane consumers can get their car without. Fortunately I drive an old car so this does not affect me\u2014yet.

Both the transmitter and receiver know the code numbers as they change because they are **programmed with the same code generating algorithm.** So, both the car and fob know what code number will be next due to sharing an algorithm.\nThe mathematics of the quasi-randomly generated codes is that it is **about a one-in-a-billion chance that a car would mistakenly unlock** because of a duplicate code transmission from a wrong fob.\n**What happens if you press the key fob button when you aren\u2019t in range of the car?** Now the car receiver and fob transmitter are no longer in sync as the fob will move one code number ahead of the car receiver.

I can see how a thief could intercept the fob\u2019s radio signal with speciality equipment  when you press the door-open or engine-start button, and then use that signal to open your car\u2019s door and drive the car away.     But I don\u2019t see how storing the fob in a metal can when it isn\u2019t being used would be of any  help.  Anybody here have an explanation?\nCrimes committed by tech-savvy car thieves using special tools purchased on the internet are contributing to a spike vehicle thefts.\nWith some cars, you don\u2019t press a button on the fob to unlock the car; you just walk up to the car. The fob is clearly transmitting all of the time (although intermittently, I\u2019m sure).\nAs for the metal can, look up a Faraday shield if you\u2019ve never heard of that, although you\u2019d probably need a metal lid to complete the enclosure.\nI\u2019ve said it before\u2026but I sure miss plain ol\u2019 metal keys.\nWith some cars, you don\u2019t press a button on the fob to unlock the car; you just walk up to the car.

The key FOBs come with the ability to start the car by way of push button. I've learned that the signals from the key FOBs can be captured and programmed to steal the car. To prevent this there are options have the FOB wrapped in aluminum foil, use a faraday bag or a tin can. I purchased the faraday bags.\nFrom the YouTube channels on Toyotas, another option is to turn the transmitting off with two clicks. I could not find any information on Hondas about doing the same thing. The Honda message boards are no where near as active as the Toyotas.

In cases like what I\u2019m trying (where it\u2019s a generic remote with no codes printed on it) and I can keep the button depressed. A somewhat slow scan should still pick up the frequency eventually.\nIn the case of  original question where he knows the frequencies.

Some suggest they're \"always transmitting\", while others say the car always interrogates, which wakes the fob up when in range. Considering the size of a fob's battery, to me it would not make sense for it to be always on, as this would deplete a CR2032 in no time. The interrogation/response seems like a more viable solution ... but ...

As I walk up to the car the doors will automatically unlock, so it is always transmitting an RF signal. The automatic door unlock is a user option I setup in the vehicle settings. If your Kia does the same you could rent or buy an anti-spy/bug detector. These devices can pickup RF signals from 1 MHz-8 GHz or greater. The purchase cost is ~ $50.\nFollow \nanswered May 24, 2022 at 1:23\n]\nMJH\n88855 silver badges88 bronze badges\n6\n*   I actually have the other key (we have two). Using one of those devices I can see whether the key that I still have transmits, and then if it does I can use that to find the missing one?\n    \u2013\u00a0\n    Commented May 24, 2022 at 2:13\n*   1\n    I read somewhere that US model cars transmit the RF signal at 315 MHz and foreign cars transmit at 433.92 MHz. You could also call Kia and ask if they would provide the RF frequency for your make and model. It should not be a security concern because they use rolling security codes.\n    \u2013\u00a0\n    Commented May 24, 2022 at 2:50\n*   4\n    Are you sure it is always transmitting, or is it just always listening for the transmitter in the car and it responds when it hears the car? I don\u2019t know, it just seems a more power efficient way of doing it to save key fob battery life.\n    \u2013\u00a0\n    Commented May 24, 2022 at 5:30\n*   @G...[Content truncated]",
