Some people don't even get that far (maybe your battery is dying on your remote, or it needs replacing, etc?). \nWhatever the case is for you, as long as your remote is working from any distance, this will help to amplify that distance for your remote, whether by 5 or 20 feet! When I got as far as the remote would work (with using my brain), it was about 85 feet away (20 feet out of the normal range). :) \nSimply put the remote up to your head (let's just say around your temple area), and click the button. \nVOILA! It works! \nPut your remote to the test by stepping back (like I do in the video below) to see how far you can get using this technique.

Second-, third-, and fourth-generation cell phones (2G, 3G, 4G) emit radiofrequency in the frequency range of 0.7\u20132.7 GHz. Fifth-generation (5G) cell phones are anticipated to use the frequency spectrum up to 80 GHz.\nThese frequencies all fall in the nonionizing range of the spectrum, which is low frequency and low energy. The energy is too low to damage DNA. By contrast, , which includes , , and cosmic rays, is high frequency and high energy. Energy from ionizing radiation can damage DNA. DNA damage can cause changes to genes that may increase the risk of cancer.\nThe NCI fact sheet  lists sources of . More information about ionizing radiation can be found on the  page.\nThe human body does absorb energy from devices that emit radiofrequency radiation. The only consistently recognized biological effect of radiofrequency radiation absorption in humans that the general public might encounter is heating to the area of the body where a cell phone is held (e.g., the ear and head). However, that heating is not sufficient to measurably increase core body temperature. There are no other clearly established dangerous health effects on the human body from radiofrequency radiation.\nHas the incidence of brain and central nervous system cancers changed during the time cell phone use increased?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNo. Investigators have studied whether the  of brain or other  cancers (that is, the number of new cases of these cancers diagnosed each year) has changed during the time that cell phone use increased dramatically. These studies found:\n*   stable incidence rates for adult  in the United States (), Nordic countries () and Australia () during the past several decades\n*   stable incidence rates for  brain tumors in the United States during 1993\u20132013 ()\n*   stable incidence rates for acoustic neuroma (), which are , and  (), which are usually nonmalignant, among US adults since 2009\u00a0\nIn addition, studies using cancer incidence data have tested different scenarios (simulations) determining whether the incidence trends are in line with various levels of risk as reported in studies of cell phone use and brain tumors between 1979 and 2008 (, ). These simulations showed that many risk changes reported in \u00a0were not consistent with incidence data, implying that \u00a0and errors in the study may have distorted the findings.\nBecause these studies examine cancer incidence trends over time in populations rather than comparing risk in people who do and don\u2019t use cell phones, their ability to observe potential small differences in risk among...[Content truncated]",

Is this just an old tech wives tale, or is there something legit about this voodoo car magic? \n Although it sounds absolutely bonkers when you first hear it (and actually it sounds just as crazy even after you do some research on it), this actually works. And for good reason, too: The oral cavity and fluids in your skull do some kind of crazy wizardry to the remote signal when you\u2019re holding the key fob to your chin. It\u2019s kind of like the reason why those ancient \u201crabbit ear\u201d TV antennas gave you better reception when you were touching them. \n The New York Times asked a Silicon Valley radio engineer, Tim Pozar, for his take on how the trick turns your head into a DIY antenna. \n If you ask William Van Winkle, it\u2019s a lot more than a few car lengths. He wrote this article for Tom\u2019s Guide earlier this month and totally confirmed that it increased his car\u2019s remote control effectiveness by about twice the length that it was before: \n Great trick! \n The home you love starts here\n The home you love starts here\nMore From Us\nFollow along\nNewsletter\nEnjoy a daily dose of house tours, before & afters, decorating hacks, and more.\n\u00a9 2024 Apartment Therapy, LLC / Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyEU and US State Data Subject Requests",

This is it's normal use.\nIf however you tested it with the fob somewhat isolated it would then be out of tune.\neg in the factory it would be tuned at a set distance from a \"dummy body\".\nIt's the same with a walkie-talkie radio. The antenna must be tuned when held in the hand, as your body provides the missing earth or ground-plane.\nYou can easily demonstrate this. Mount an antenna on a ground-plane with a length of coax, a SWR meter and a transmitter. Tune the antenna so the SWR is 1:1 and then move you hand close to the antenna. Once your hand gets withing a wavelength or so, the effect of the \"detuning\" can be readily seen on the SWR meter.\njpk 6 months ago | parent | next \nThis reminds me of a class in college where one project was to make a waveguide WiFi antenna.

It makes some sounds louder so that a person with hearing loss can listen, communicate, and participate more fully in daily activities. A hearing aid can help people hear more in both quiet and noisy situations. However, only about one out of five people who would benefit from a hearing aid actually uses one.\nA hearing aid has three basic parts: a microphone, amplifier, and speaker. The hearing aid receives sound through a microphone, which converts the sound waves to electrical signals and sends them to an amplifier. The amplifier increases the power of the signals and then sends them to the ear through a speaker.\nHow can hearing aids help?\n--------------------------\nHearing aids are primarily useful in improving the hearing and speech comprehension of people who have hearing loss that results from damage to the small sensory cells in the inner ear, called hair cells. This type of hearing loss is called sensorineural hearing loss. The damage can occur as a result of disease, aging, or injury from noise or certain medicines.\nA hearing aid magnifies sound vibrations entering the ear. Surviving hair cells detect the larger vibrations and convert them into neural signals that are passed along to the brain. The greater the damage to a person\u2019s hair cells, the more severe the hearing loss, and the greater the hearing aid amplification needed to make up the difference. However, there are practical limits to the amount of amplification a hearing aid can provide. In addition, if the inner ear is too damaged, even large vibrations will not be converted into neural signals. In this situation, a hearing aid would be ineffective.\nWhere can I get help with my hearing loss?\n------------------------------------------\nIf you or an adult family member have questions or concerns about hearing loss, you have options.  are a new category of hearing...[Content truncated]",
