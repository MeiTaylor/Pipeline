Alas, plenty of the aforementioned people have given me the tip to hold the remote to my chin with my mouth slightly open to increase the range of the remote signal. Is this just an old tech wives tale, or is there something legit about this voodoo car magic?\nAlthough it sounds absolutely bonkers when you first hear it (and actually it sounds just as crazy even after you do some research on it), this actually works. And for good reason, too: The oral cavity and fluids in your skull do some kind of crazy wizardry to the remote signal when you\u2019re holding the key fob to your chin. It\u2019s kind of like the reason why those ancient \u201crabbit ear\u201d TV antennas gave you better reception when you were touching them.\nThe  asked a Silicon Valley radio engineer, Tim Pozar, for his take on how the trick turns your head into a DIY antenna.\n> _Mr. Pozar explains, \u201cYou are capacitively coupling the fob to your head. With all the fluids in your head it ends up being a nice conductor. Not a great one, but it works.\u201d Using your head can extend the key\u2019s wireless range by a few car lengths._\nIf you ask William Van Winkle, it\u2019s a lot more than a few car lengths. He wrote  for Tom\u2019s Guide earlier this month and totally confirmed that it increased his car\u2019s remote control effectiveness by about twice the length that it was before:\n> _One step back beyond the point of being out of range, I confirmed that the remote didn\u2019t work.

Leaving a mall, a concert, or a sporting event when reality abruptly crashes in. Looking out onto the expanse of the parking lot and your mind draws a blank. Dude\u2026where\u2019s my car?\nIf you find yourself wandering rows of vehicles, indiscriminately clicking the unlock button of your car\u2019s remote key fob, there\u2019s a rumored trick to extend the remote\u2019s range and improve your chances of finding your car. The trick? Hold the remote to your head.  \nWhen hearing this your first thought might be, \u201cThis has to be a practical joke.\u201d Well, we put this trick to the test with physics-based simulation software.  \nThe theory says that you can create a range boost by using your own head like an antenna. You capacitively couple the signal to your head, which is filled with fluids that act as a conductor for the signal. If this is true, you should be able to extend the range of your fob by a few car lengths.\nUsing the electromagnetic simulation software , we tested this theory by comparing a remote keyless entry (RKE) signal alone, held away from the head, and against the head. The sample RKE used in the simulation has a 315 MHz frequency, FR4 substrate, and is comprised of a small \u201cloop\u201d with a patch section representing other components and printed circuit board traces.\n!\n_Remote keyless entry model_\nTo establish a reference point, the remote\u2019s signal was first simulated without a human body model, held at a representative height above an asphalt ground.\n<table><tbody><tr style=\"height: 100%\"><td style=\"width: 50%\"><img src=\"https://altair.com/images/default-source/resource-images/figure-3-1-1.png?Status=Master&amp;sfvrsn=c4157622_5\" alt=\"\"></td><td style=\"width: 50%\"><img src=\"https://altair.com/images/default-source/resource-images/figure-44f1bb7e6-b422-4ab2-a6fb-f889d01c6b84.png?Status=Master&amp;sfvrsn=acccdbb_7\" alt=\"\"></td></tr></tbody></table>\n_Baseline RKE signal without human body model_\nNext, an articulated human model was introduced.

So I used some kind of roof flashing coiled into a cylinder to get the length and radius tuned just right, and I fashioned a comfy handle to aim it using some scrap aluminum flat, and round wood stock.\nMine did really well, but it also had the widest variance in performance. We figured out that my wood handle could be held in a way in which you didn't actually touch any metal, but if you put your thumb up on the aluminum part of the handle, it instantly got way better SNR!\nThe instructor told us that touching the housing improved the quality of the ground because the capacitance of our meat acts like a short at those high frequencies.\nAloha 6 months ago | root | parent | next \nYes - and not surprising, it's functionally acting like a ground plane.\nwallaBBB 6 months ago | parent | prev | next \nNot really - antenna is tuned to the maximum allowed emission power per local regulations (e.g. big differences between EU, US and JPN regulations). Certification tests do not include any human handling, since it's really unpredictable and varies. Therefore, tests are just the fob with a (per specifications) positioned Rx antenna (highly controlled environment).\nBTW similar effect is observed with the fob being next to the bottle of water. There are peer reviewed studies on these topics, that my RF engineer shared with me when I asked him way back about it, but are heavy on the RF/antenna theory, beyond my understanding.\ngreggsy 6 months ago | root | parent | next \nI read it in the sense that they would retune or reengineer it if it was discovered that holding it in a hand resulted in poorer performance - ie. they need to factor in the environment it operates in (a hand beside a body) after they design it on paper.\nwallaBBB 6 months ago | root | parent | next \nThere are 2 limiting factors taken into account during design - regulations and peak current that the battery can supply.\nThe battery thing (usually a coin cell CR2032 that can supply ~13mA per spec) can be a bit mitigated with a beefy capacitor (though RF packet length and space in-between have to be appropriate for the capacitor recovery, not to brown out the system).\nUsually the bigger bottleneck is the regulation, so you tune for best performance in a clean environment.

To confirm any of this would take some careful measurements with fairly sophisticated equipment.\nTwo things come to mind. First, just raising the remote should help with its range. Try holding it up at chin level but not near your head.\nSecond, it's possible that the length of your body is roughly resonant at the RF frequecy. By feeding the signal into your body antenna at one end and with the other end loosely coupled to ground your whole body might start acting like a antenna. With the transmitter at waiste level, your body antenna is center fed, which doesn't cause it to resonate as well. Again, this is all just speculation.\nCite\nFollow \nanswered Nov 1, 2011 at 23:33\n]\nOlin Lathrop\n314k3636 gold badges440440 silver badges928928 bronze badges\n\\\\$\\\\endgroup\\\\$\n1\n*   4\n    \\\\$\\\\begingroup\\\\$ And if you face away from the car and look over your shoulder, you can act as a helical antenna too :) \\\\$\\\\endgroup\\\\$\n    \u2013\u00a0\n    Commented Nov 2, 2011 at 8:48\n \u00a0|\u00a0\n5\n\\\\$\\\\begingroup\\\\$\nI posed this same question to my Electromagnetics professor.

What matters is that the bottom of the remote is pointing to the car.  You can point it to your chin or your left big toe or the planet Uranus, just so long as the bottom of the remote points to car.\nHere is a link to a video clip of the British TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson on the TV show Top Gear testing the key fob range on his Mercedes SL by holding it against the side of his head and then just pointing it and it does show significantly more range when he is holding it against his head.  He read a few emails on the following show of explantions people had emailed in but they didn\u2019t present a definitive conclusion.\nSo you suggest that this rod is implanted in one\u2019s body and you think you could make money off this idea?\nIs there a general problem with poor range from remote keyless transmitters? How much range would you have to have to call it good?\nIs this something like a car thats getting the advertised mpg but the owner wants more?\nI would have liked it more if you had said you tested it outside the lab,like in a parking lot with all the interference your lab test was free from.\nI\u2019m not suggesting to implant that rod, it would be a separate device and I am not interested in making money of that.\nThe poor range of keyless transmitters is due to: 1.-the very low output power( the device has to work on a small battery for a long time) and 2.- the small antenna aperture causing a low antenna gain.\nTesting in the lab is the only way so see what effect it has if you point that remote to your body. In the real outside world range is of course depending on all other effects as well. But these outside world effects apply to all...[Content truncated]",

If so, you may have heard the peculiar tip of holding the remote to your chin or head to boost the signal. While this may sound like an old wives' tale or a bizarre car magic trick, there may actually be some truth to it. In this article, we'll explore the phenomenon of holding your car's remote next to your head and uncover whether it truly enhances its range. So, let's dive in and unravel the mystery behind this peculiar practice.\n### The Science Behind the Trick\nTo understand why holding your car's remote next to your head might improve its range, we need to delve into the realm of electromagnetic waves and the human body. According to a Silicon Valley radio engineer, Tim Pozar, when you hold the remote to your head, you are capacitively coupling it to your head, creating a conductor due to the fluids present in your skull. Although not a perfect conductor, this connection allows the remote signal to travel further, effectively extending its wireless range by a few car lengths.\n### Water and Electromagnetic Waves\nOne crucial factor that contributes to the effectiveness of holding the key fob to your head is the presence of water in the human body. Approximately 60% of our body is composed of water. This water, when inside a cavity like our oral cavity, responds to electromagnetic waves in a beneficial manner. When the radio waves emitted by the key fob enter our water-dense body, a phenomenon known as a \"dielectric resonator\" occurs. This resonator amplifies the amplitude of the waves, ultimately increasing the range of the remote.\n### Anecdotal Evidence\nWhile the scientific explanation behind holding the remote to your head seems plausible, it's essential to consider the anecdotal evidence shared by individuals who have attempted this technique. Many people claim that they have experienced an improvement in their car's remote control effectiveness by holding the remote to their chin or head. In fact, some have reported being able to unlock or lock their car from a significantly greater distance than before\n### Personal Experiments\nTo put this theory to the test, several individuals have conducted their own experiments to determine whether holding the car's remote next to their head truly enhances its range. One such experiment was conducted by William Van Winkle, who wrote an article for Tom's Guide. He confirmed that holding the remote to his chin increased his car's remote control effectiveness by approximately twice the previous range...[Content truncated]",
