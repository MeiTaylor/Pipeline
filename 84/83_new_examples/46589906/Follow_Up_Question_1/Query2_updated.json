While a head is much bigger, and if conditions are just right, radiation resistance will be higher, a human head is also much less conductive than copper. _Maybe_ your explanation is correct, but as it stands, with no sources, and no data, -1 for unsubstantiated guessing. \n    \u2013\u00a0\n*   1\n     It's also quite possible to make electrically small loops with efficiencies greater than 1%. An efficient antenna isn't at the top list of engineering priorities for a car remote (cost is probably higher), but again, you have cited no sources. \n    \u2013\u00a0\n*    The key issue is the surprisingly low radiation resistance of a key fob antenna.  calculates it as 0.0227 Ohm (page 2). The \"body-arm-head\" loop radiation resistance is _TENS_ of ohms - 100x to 1000x larger. \n    \u2013\u00a0\n*    Radiation resistance alone is not a measure of antenna efficiency. Rather, (efficiency) = (radiation resistance) / (radiation resistance + all other losses). A loop of copper is going to have a much lower ohmic loss than a body-arm-head. Water (such as in said body-arm-head) also experiences significant dielectric loss, where the copper antenna does not. Without doing any measurements, it's not hard to imagine losses being 100x to 1000x higher in a human body compared to a copper loop. \n    \u2013\u00a0\n\u00a0|\u00a0 \nThis answer is useful\n10\nSave this answer.\nShow activity on this post.\nThe way it works has nothing to do with your body. Remotes have their antenna as a more or less circular trace on the board (a loop antenna). The strongest signal is when the top or base of the remote is pointed at the receiver. The weakest signal is when the fob is pointed 90 degrees away, such as when pointing it like a TV remote. Guess which way most people point it? Guess which way it's pointing when you hold it to...[Content truncated]",

Alas, plenty of the aforementioned people have given me the tip to hold the remote to my chin with my mouth slightly open to increase the range of the remote signal. Is this just an old tech wives tale, or is there something legit about this voodoo car magic?\nAlthough it sounds absolutely bonkers when you first hear it (and actually it sounds just as crazy even after you do some research on it), this actually works. And for good reason, too: The oral cavity and fluids in your skull do some kind of crazy wizardry to the remote signal when you\u2019re holding the key fob to your chin. It\u2019s kind of like the reason why those ancient \u201crabbit ear\u201d TV antennas gave you better reception when you were touching them.\nThe  asked a Silicon Valley radio engineer, Tim Pozar, for his take on how the trick turns your head into a DIY antenna.\n> _Mr. Pozar explains, \u201cYou are capacitively coupling the fob to your head. With all the fluids in your head it ends up being a nice conductor. Not a great one...[Content truncated]",

Dude\u2026where\u2019s my car?\nIf you find yourself wandering rows of vehicles, indiscriminately clicking the unlock button of your car\u2019s remote key fob, there\u2019s a rumored trick to extend the remote\u2019s range and improve your chances of finding your car. The trick? Hold the remote to your head.  \nWhen hearing this your first thought might be, \u201cThis has to be a practical joke.\u201d Well, we put this trick to the test with physics-based simulation software.  \nThe theory says that you can create a range boost by using your own head like an antenna. You capacitively couple the signal to your head, which is filled with fluids that act as a conductor for the signal. If this is true, you should be able to extend the range of your fob by a few car lengths.\nUsing the electromagnetic simulation software , we tested this theory by comparing a remote keyless entry (RKE) signal alone, held away from the head, and against the head. The sample RKE used in the simulation has a 315 MHz frequency, FR4 substrate, and is comprised of a small \u201cloop\u201d with a patch section representing other components and printed circuit board traces.\n!\n_Remote keyless entry model_\nTo establish a reference point, the remote\u2019s signal was first simulated without a human body model, held at a representative height above an asphalt ground.\n<table><tbody><tr style=\"height: 100%\"><td style=\"width: 50%\"><img src=\"https://altair.com/images/default-source/resource-images/figure-3-1-1.png?Status=Master&amp;sfvrsn=c4157622_5\" alt=\"\"></td><td style=\"width: 50%\"><img src=\"https://altair.com/images/default-source/resource-images/figure-44f1bb7e6-b422-4ab2-a6fb-f889d01c6b84.png?Status=Master&amp;sfvrsn=acccdbb_7\" alt=\"\"></td></tr></tbody></table>\n_Baseline RKE signal without human body model_\nNext, an articulated human model was introduced. Holding the RKE with an outstretched arm at the same height as the previous experiment, the electromagnetic simulation was run again. The simulation showed a couple interesting differences. First, the range was increased with the introduction of the human model. The pattern was also more directive, increasing the realized gain in the forward direction toward the RKE\u2019s target.\n<table><tbody><tr style=\"height: 100...[Content truncated]",

The Committees also draw the Commission's attention to the new or emerging problems which may pose an actual or potential threat. They are: the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS), the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) and the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR). In addition, the Commission relies upon the work of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the European Centre for Disease prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). \nSCENIHR \nThis Committee deals with questions related to emerging or newly identified health and environmental risks and on broad, complex or multidisciplinary issues requiring acomprehensive assessment of risks to consumer safety or public health and related issues not covered by other Community risk assessment bodies. Examples of potential areas of activity include potential risks associated with interaction of risk factors, synergic effects, cumulative effects, antimicrobial resistance, new technologies such as nanotechnologies, medical devices including those incorporating substances of animal and/or human origin, tissue engineering, blood products, fertility reduction, cancer of endocrine organs, physical hazards such as noise and electromagnetic fields (from mobile phones, transmitters and electronically controlled home environments), and methodologies for assessing new risks.

The microFLOQ\u00ae Direct swab, a miniaturized version of the 4N6 FLOQSwab\u00ae, has a small swab head that is treated with a lysing agent which allows for direct amplification and DNA profiling from sample collection to final result in less than two hours. Additionally, the microFLOQ\u00ae system subsamples only a minute portion of a stain and preserves the vast majority of the sample for subsequent testing or re-analysis, if desired. The efficacy of direct amplification of DNA from dilute bloodstains, saliva stains, and touch samples was evaluated using microFLOQ\u00ae Direct swabs and the GlobalFiler\u2122 Express system. Comparisons were made to traditional methods to assess the robustness of this alternate workflow. Controlled studies with 1:19 and 1:99 dilutions of bloodstains and saliva stains consistently yielded higher STR peak heights than standard methods with 1\u00a0ng input DNA from the same samples. Touch samples from common items yielded single source and mixed profiles that were consistent with primary users of the objects. With this novel methodology/workflow, no sample loss occurs and therefore more template DNA is available during amplification. This approach may have important implications for analysis of low quantity and/or degraded samples that plague forensic casework.\nKeywords\n--------\ndirect PCR\nbloodstain\nsaliva\ntouch DNA\nmicroFLOQ\u00ae\n4N6 FLOQSwabs\u00ae\nGlobalFiler\u2122\nGlobalFiler\u2122 Express\nCited by (0)\n------------\n\u00a9 2017 The Authors.

You\u2019d think such a huge animal wouldn't be hard to miss. But because the ocean is vast and giant squid live deep underwater, they remain elusive and are rarely seen: most of what we know comes from dead carcasses that floated to the surface and were found by fishermen.\nBut after years of searching, in 2012 a group of scientists from Japan's National Science Museum along with colleagues from Japanese public broadcaster NHK and the Discovery Channel  for the first time. The species was , after researchers suspended bait beneath a research vessel off the Ogasawara Islands to try and hook a giant squid. As the camera whirred, the research team pulled a 24-foot (7-meter) squid to the surface alive enabling people around the world to finally see a living, breathing giant squid.\nAnatomy, Diversity & Evolution\n------------------------------\n### Anatomy\n**Giant squid** have eight arms but use their two long feeding tentacles to seize prey. (Smithsonian Institution)\nA giant squid\u2019s body may look pretty simple: Like other squids and octopuses, it has two eyes, a beak, eight arms, two feeding tentacles, and a funnel (also called a siphon). But, of course, all of it is much larger!\nFEEDING TENTACLES  \nGiant squid can snatch prey up to 33 feet (10 meters) away by shooting out their two , which are tipped with hundreds of powerful . These feeding tentacles are very long, often doubling the total length of the giant squid on their own.\nARMS AND BEAK  \nEight thick arms speckled with 2-inch wide toothed suckers guide prey from...[Content truncated]",

It makes some sounds louder so that a person with hearing loss can listen, communicate, and participate more fully in daily activities. A hearing aid can help people hear more in both quiet and noisy situations. However, only about one out of five people who would benefit from a hearing aid actually uses one.\nA hearing aid has three basic parts: a microphone, amplifier, and speaker. The hearing aid receives sound through a microphone, which converts the sound waves to electrical signals and sends them to an amplifier. The amplifier increases the power of the signals and then sends them to the ear through a speaker.\nHow can hearing aids help?\n--------------------------\nHearing aids are primarily useful in improving the hearing and speech comprehension of people who have hearing loss that results from damage to the small sensory cells in the inner ear, called hair cells. This type of hearing loss is called sensorineural hearing loss. The damage can occur as a result of disease, aging, or injury from noise or certain medicines.\nA hearing aid magnifies sound vibrations entering the ear. Surviving hair cells detect the larger vibrations and convert them into neural signals that are passed along to the brain. The greater the damage to a person\u2019s hair cells, the more severe the hearing loss, and the greater the hearing aid amplification needed to make up the difference. However, there are practical limits to the amount of amplification a hearing aid can provide. In addition, if the inner ear is too damaged, even large vibrations will not be converted into neural signals. In this situation, a hearing aid would be ineffective.\nWhere can I get help with my hearing loss?\n------------------------------------------\nIf you...[Content truncated]",
