Later on, Biden somewhat picked up the pace to push back against Trump’s slew of factually incorrect assertions about immigration and abortion.\nHowever, Democrats raised the alarm over Biden’s performance, with some even starting to talk about replacing him on the presidential ticket.\n“There are going to be discussions about whether he [Biden] should continue,” David Axelrod, former senior adviser to former President Barack Obama, told CNN.\nWhile Biden’s Vice President Kamala Harris backed him after the debate, saying substance matters over style in this election, even she conceded “it was a slow start”.\n \n\n \nBiden and Trump went back and forth over which of them is physically and cognitively stronger.\nTrump boasted about his strength, claiming, “I’m in as good shape as I was 25, 30 years ago,” to moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash.\nIn response, a snickering Biden implied his opponent was lying about both his height and weight.\nTrump said he had won two championships on his golf course while Biden “can’t hit the ball 50 yards”.\nThis prompted Biden to challenge Trump to a golf match, only if Trump would carry his own bag.\n“Let’s not act like children,” said Trump.\n“You are a child,” responded Biden.\n \n\n \n“We are the biggest producer of support for Israel of anyone in the world,” Biden said, reiterating US support for Israel’s war on Gaza in which more than 37,718 Palestinians have been killed since October last year.\nBiden added that his administration is continuing to send experts and intelligence to hinder Palestinian group Hamas in the war.\nTrump snapped back, saying it is Israel that wants to continue with the war, “and you should let them go, and let them finish the job. He [Biden] doesn’t want to do it. He’s become like a Palestinian, but they don’t like him because he’s a very bad Palestinian, he’s a weak one”.\nIn the nearly nine months of the war that has left Gaza rife with power outages and food insecurity, the United States has provided military and diplomatic assistance to Israel, and has repeatedly blocked ceasefire resolutions. A US-sponsored resolution endorsing a ceasefire proposal eventually only passed at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) some eight months into the war.\n \n\n \nTrump invoked anti-abortion sentiment by accusing Biden and his party of allowing late-term abortions.\nDuring the debate, Trump claimed Biden and...[Content truncated]",

Kennedy and Richard Nixon started the tradition of televised debates in 1960 — then, as on Thursday, in a television studio with no audience.\n    \n\n            Minutes into the showdown, hosted by CNN, a full-blown Democratic panic was underway at the idea of heading into the election with such a diminished figure at the top of the ticket.\n    \n\n            Biden’s chief debate coach, Ron Klain, famously argues that “while you can lose a debate at any time, you can only win it in the first 30 minutes.” By that standard, the president’s showing was devastating. The tone of the evening was set well before the half hour.\n    \n\n            It is too early to say how voters will respond and whether the president can rescue himself.

        "Question": "Is there verified evidence of Joe Biden actually saying, 'You're one sexy kid' in the video?",
        "Answer": "No, there is no verified evidence that Joe Biden actually said, \"You're one sexy kid\" in the video. The claim originates from an audio snippet that has been analyzed and determined to be altered. According to a source, Biden appears to be heard saying, \"Let me whisper you a secret. You’re one sexy kid. Don’t tell mommy what I told you. You got it?\" However, this audio has been confirmed to be part of a modified version of the original content, where context and intent have been misrepresented. Further investigation by Politifact indicated that the claims involving Biden's comments were taken out of context. In the original video, he is engaging with a woman who is carrying a child, and the implications of inappropriate comments are attributed to an audio alteration that cropped out the mother, altering the perception of the interaction. The evidence collectively suggests that not only is the claim based on an altered audio but that responsible fact-checking has debunked the notion of Biden making such a statement inappropriately. Given this analysis, I would rate my confidence in this conclusion at 95%.",
