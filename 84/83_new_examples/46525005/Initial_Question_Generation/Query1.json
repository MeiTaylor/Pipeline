C-SPAN footage of the event (archived here) shows Biden interacting with the mother and her child at approximately the 48-minute mark. \nAsked in a comment under her post what Biden told her son, the mother said: \"I don't think he told him anything because I didn't hear him say anything I think he just pretended to say something.\"\nReplying to another user, she joked that Biden said her son \"will be the first Mexican president of the United States.\"\nAFP reached out to the woman and the White House for additional comment, but no responses were forthcoming.\nAnother altered version of the video previously circulated online, with a loud sniffing noise dubbed over the audio to make it appear as though Biden had leaned in to smell the child.\nAFP has debunked other misinformation accusing Biden of inappropriate conduct...[Content truncated]",

Don’t tell Mommy what I told you. You got it?”\nA woman turns the camera onto herself and Biden, and there’s a short pause before she’s heard saying, “I’m recording you.”\n“He didn’t (know) it was being recorded!” reads on-screen text included in the video.

The riot is currently being investigated by a congressional panel.\nThe video was published on the Democrats' official Twitter account on Wednesday, and quickly became part of a wider conspiracy theory.\nPosts doubting the legitimacy of the video have been shared thousands of times, including by prominent pundits from the right-wing US television channels Newsmax and One America News. \nOne reason people have cast doubt on the video is because they say President Biden looks different in another video published on the same day - which some people have also claimed is fake.\nBut the differences in his appearance are clearly due to the lighting used when filming.\nPeople have also claimed the video is suspicious because he doesn't blink - but that wouldn't prove the video was a deepfake.  \nOne post that has been retweeted almost 40,000 times says \"a normal person blinks their eye...[Content truncated]",

You’re one sexy kid. Don’t tell mommy what I told you. You got it?”\nThe president then poses with the girl, before she informs him that she is in fact recording the interaction, to which Biden reacts with surprise.\nThe audio therefore appears to implicate the president with sexual harassment of a minor.\n### **Altered Audio**\nWhen we did a search on the comments attributed to Biden in the video, we found that it was an altered version of the original, and a similar claim with a different altered version had been debunked by  in October 2023.\nPolitifact indicated that the original video was recorded at a , where Biden signed an executive order ‘aimed at advancing economic security for military families’. They also included a link to a  uploaded on 10 June 2023, which they indicated was the original video.\nThe video, by creator saucedofamily, appears to show that the ‘girl’ featured is actually a mother who is carrying a baby. The baby cannot be seen in the altered version, which is cropped.\nIn the original video, it is clear that Biden is speaking to the child, while referring to the woman carrying the child as the mother in his comments.\nThe audio does not record Biden saying, ‘You’re one sexy kid,”. However, the rest of the audio is the same as in the altered video.\n!\n!\nThe creator also claims that the comments the president made were audible to her, and that he told her baby that ‘he will be the first Mexican president’.\nPolitifact reported that an altered version of the video had  in October 2023, where it has been flagged by Politifact and the Portuguese factchecker Poligrafo.\nWe therefore find the claim that Biden made inappropriate comments towards a girl or young woman...[Content truncated]",
