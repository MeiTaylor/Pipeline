Israelis believe King David had a garden in biblical times.\nAbout 1,500 people living in more than 100 buildings in the al-Bustan area of Silwan in occupied East Jerusalem are under threat.\nLast Monday, Jerusalem Municipality inspectors, accompanied by Israeli forces, delivered a notice to demolish a home within 21 days, after an Israeli court ruled earlier it had been constructed without a building permit. Twelve other residences also face imminent demolition orders after legal challenges were exhausted.\n\u201cStating that the order was delivered is somewhat inaccurate,\u201d said social activist Angela Godfrey-Goldstein, the co-director of the Jahalin Solidarity organisation.\n\u201cWhen inspectors deliver orders to Palestinians, they don\u2019t give them in person or even affix them to the relevant doors despite the notices saying \u2018demolition within 21-days of receipt\u2019,\u201d Godfrey-Goldstein told Al Jazeera.\nNotices are often not received, blow away, and are sometimes found on the ground, she said.\n\u201cHence, many Palestinians only know their houses are about to be demolished when they wake up to the sound of doors being bashed in or the day before when inspectors come to photograph their target,\u201d explained Godfrey-Goldstein, a former member of the Israeli Committee Against Home Demolitions, which fights the destruction of Palestinian homes in the Israeli occupied territories.\n \n\n \nThe Jerusalem Municipality very seldom approves Palestinian building permits in its continuing effort to Judaise the eastern sector of the city which includes facilitating illegal Jewish settlement building, the forced expulsion of Palestinian residents to make way for Jewish settlers and the planned destruction of hundreds of Palestinian homes.\nJerusalem deputy mayors Arieh King and Fleur Hassan-Nahoum are on record recently confirming that the aim of the state was to limit Palestinian construction in East Jerusalem as a deliberate policy that favoured Jews to protect Israel\u2019s character, saying Israel was a Jewish state.\nThree generations, more than 30 people, live in the homes of Fakhri Abu Diab and his brother, Nader Abu Diab. Nader\u2019s building is listed to be demolished within the next few weeks.\nThe families\u2019 appeals against the 2019 Israeli court decision authorising the demolitions were dismissed in 2020. Orders to proceed were issued in March of this year and the final notice was delivered on Monday.\n\u201cMy family has lived in this home for decades, long before Israel occupied East Jerusalem,\u201d said Fakhri Abu Diab, an accountant by profession and a spokesman for the Silwan Land Defense Committee.\n\u201cWhen I got married in 1988, I tried for nearly three years to get a building permit to enlarge my home as my family expanded.\n\u201cI went dozens of times to Jerusalem Municipality, sometimes accompanied...[Content truncated]",

There is almost no way for Palestinians to challenge demolition orders in the court, and besides, orders are rarely given directly to affected families; they might be strung up on a nearby building, or littered on the ground. Sometimes, the first inclination you might have that your home is being destroyed is the sound of bulldozers outside.\nSince 2005, residents of al-Bustan have received warnings to demolish nearly 90 homes, on the pretext that extensions and buildings have been constructed without permits. Although Palestinians make up the majority of the population of East Jerusalem, Israeli zoning laws have marked out 35 percent of the land area to be for illegal settlements, and another 52 percent for \u2018green areas\u2019, where construction is prohibited. This is one example of Israel\u2019s larger programme of \u2018displace and replace\u2019: the demolition of homes to make way for \u2018green space\u2019, emptiness, is particularly insidious.\nThe plan for the replacement of al-Bustan is Gan Hamelech Park, billed as a new biblical theme park for the city of Jerusalem, which is to be linked to the pre-existing City of David national park. The development plan includes archeological excavations culminating in the \u2018restoration\u2019 of the park, the planting of a \u2018blooming garden\u2019, a touristic zone complete with restaurants, galleries and museums, as well as a new residential neighbourhood for settlers.\nThe role of the heritage industry has a long history in Israel\u2019s war on Palestine. In the words of Benedict Anderson, \u2018colonial regimes begin by attaching themselves to antiquity as much as conquest.\u2019 In the case of Israel, the claim to the Silwan neighbourhood is based on the biblical significance of the land. El\u2019Ad, a not-for-profit organisation with ties to the far-right settler movement, has been almost exclusively responsible for both archaeological excavations and a residential redevelopment project in Silwan since the 1990s. The City of David is supposedly the old seat of power of King David, described in the Hebrew Bible as the King of Israel and Judah.\nThe park is a leading touristic site in Jerusalem, but also a political and territorial weapon: in their excavations, El\u2019Ad prioritises biblical findings above all else. From the visitor centre to tours of the land, international tourists are presented with a history that is exclusively biblical, erasing a long Palestinian heritage and contemporary urban life, and implying a shame that the Holy land is being used and possessed by non-Jews.

Earlier this month, clashes between Arabs and Israeli security forces broke out at the site after human bones were reportedly uncovered by workers at the site.Video and photos shared by Palestinian media showed the alleged remains laying in the dirt at the site; they have not yet been identified.  Despite only a small number of bones being photographed, the official Palestinian Authority WAFA news agency claimed that the bones of \u201cdozens\u201d of deceased persons were uncovered in the reported incident.Mustafa Abu Zahra, head of the Committee for the Care of Islamic Cemeteries in Jerusalem, told WAFA that Israeli workers were completely covering the cemetery with dirt on Tuesday and claimed that the area included the graves of people who had died before 1967.

When interviewed she declared, \u201cIsrael is chasing Jerusalemites, alive and dead, to erase their presence in their city, and to control and Judaise the city,\u201d and went on to say: \u201cover my dead body will they dig up my son\u2019s grave.\u201d\nThe project is being carried out as a part of the Israeli agenda to destroy Islamic sites in Jerusalem. Israelis have been carrying out this plan for years. For instance, parts of the Ma\u2019man Allah Cemetery was destroyed, renamed \u2018Mamilla\u2019 and is now a public park and museum. Only a few broken tombstones remain in the area.\nThe Israel Nature and Parks Authority reported to have found human remains during the construction of the national park.

We profiled one family in detail each month, conducting interviews and capturing 360\u00b0 images of their demolished homes. Each story in the below timeline helps to reveal the scale and scope of Israel's policy of home demolitions - from the destruction of Palestinian gravesites and doghouses, to families being forced to tear down their own homes as a cost-effective alternative to having it done by Israeli authorities, to children living in tents atop the rubble.\nJanuary\n-------\n#### 16 demolitions this month\n!\n12\nPeople displaced or affected\nA Palestinian family was forced to self-demolish their home, which had been under construction in Beit Hanina, for lacking an Israeli building permit. The family said they began building the home in late December 2015, spending around $5,000 on construction materials to get started. Almost immediately, they received a demolition order. In order to avoid the high costs associated with having municipal authorities demolish their home, they opted for self-demolition instead, taking it apart brick by brick.\n2\nJabal Mukaber\nJanuary 4\n8\nPeople displaced or affected\nIsraeli forces used sledgehammers to smash the walls of Mohammed Allyan's home, the middle storey of a three-storey building. The demolition was punitive: Mohammed's son, Bahaa, was accused in a deadly shooting and stabbing attack in the East Talpiot Jewish settlement in October 2015. Bahaa was killed at the scene of the attack and the demolition order was swiftly issued. Although the family had appealed to Israel's Supreme Court, the order was upheld. Eight members of the family were displaced, forced to erect a tent by the ruins of their old home.\n##### Mohammed Allyan describes his family's loss\n3\nJabal Mukaber\nJanuary 4\n5\nPeople displaced or affected\nIsraeli forces punitively sealed with concrete the family home of Alaa Abu Jamal, who was involved in an October 201...[Content truncated]",
