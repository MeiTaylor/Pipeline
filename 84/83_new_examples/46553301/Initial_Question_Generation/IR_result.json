These were met with excessive and deadly force by Israeli authorities with thousands injured, arrested and detained.\nThe events of May 2021 were emblematic of the oppression which Palestinians have faced every day, for decades. The discrimination, the dispossession, the repression of dissent, the killings and injuries – all are part of a system which is designed to privilege Jewish Israelis at the expense of Palestinians.\n**This is** **apartheid**.\nAmnesty International’s new investigation shows that Israel imposes a system of oppression and domination against Palestinians across all areas under its control: in Israel and the OPT, and against Palestinian refugees, in order to benefit Jewish Israelis. This amounts to apartheid as prohibited in international law.\nLaws, policies and practices which are intended to maintain a cruel system of control over Palestinians, have left them fragmented geographically and politically, frequently impoverished, and in a constant state of fear and insecurity.\nWHAT IS APARTHEID?\n------------------\nApartheid is a violation of public international law, a grave violation of internationally protected human rights, and a crime against humanity under international criminal law.\nThe term “apartheid” was originally used to refer to a political system in South Africa which explicitly enforced racial segregation, and the domination and oppression of one racial group by another. It has since been adopted by the international community to condemn and criminalize such systems and practices wherever they occur in the world.\n**The crime against humanity of apartheid under the Apartheid Convention, the Rome Statute and customary international law is committed when any inhuman or inhumane act (essentially a serious human rights violation) is perpetrated in the context of an institutionalised regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over another, with the intention to maintain that system**.\nApartheid can best be understood as a system of prolonged and cruel discriminatory treatment by one racial group of members of another with the intention to control the second racial group.\n**Amnesty International has created a free 90-minute course called “Deconstructing Israel’s Apartheid Against Palestinians”.** To learn more about the crime of apartheid in international law, what apartheid looks like in Israel/OPT, and how it affects Palestinians’ lives, sign up to our course on Amnesty International’s human rights education academy.\n!\nPalestinians wait to cross the Qalandia checkpoint between Ramallah and East Jerusalem, both in the occupied West Bank, as they head to...[Content truncated]",

        "Answer": "Yes, there is verified evidence that Israeli law enforcement officers were present at the grave site as claimed. Reports indicate that during the construction efforts related to the development of a park over a cemetery in Jerusalem, Israeli police forcibly removed a Palestinian mother, Ola Nababteh, from her son's grave. This incident was highlighted in several articles: 1. One report details how Ola Nababteh was \"dragged away from Al-Yusufiyah cemetery by Israeli police as a digger truck levelled land for a new park\" while she was attempting to cling to her son's gravestone, expressing her grief and resistance to the ongoing construction efforts [Query 2_evidence_1]. 2. Additional evidence from another article supports this by mentioning that footage of Ola Nababteh shielding her son's grave from the proposed biblical theme park has provoked significant outrage, further demonstrating the presence and involvement of Israeli authorities in actions related to the cemetery [Query 2_evidence_2]. These sources confirm the presence of Israeli law enforcement at the grave site, specifically during a situation where they forcibly removed a grieving mother amidst the context of construction plans that threaten the burial site.",
