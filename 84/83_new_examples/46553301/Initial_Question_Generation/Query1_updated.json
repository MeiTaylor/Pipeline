These were met with excessive and deadly force by Israeli authorities with thousands injured, arrested and detained.\nThe events of May 2021 were emblematic of the oppression which Palestinians have faced every day, for decades. The discrimination, the dispossession, the repression of dissent, the killings and injuries \u2013 all are part of a system which is designed to privilege Jewish Israelis at the expense of Palestinians.\n**This is** **apartheid**.\nAmnesty International\u2019s new investigation shows that Israel imposes a system of oppression and domination against Palestinians across all areas under its control: in Israel and the OPT, and against Palestinian refugees, in order to benefit Jewish Israelis. This amounts to apartheid as prohibited in international law.\nLaws, policies and practices which are intended to maintain a cruel system of control over Palestinians, have left them fragmented geographically and politically, frequently impoverished, and in a constant state of fear and insecurity.\nWHAT IS APARTHEID?\n------------------\nApartheid is a violation of public international law, a grave violation of internationally protected human rights, and a crime against humanity under international criminal law.\nThe term \u201capartheid\u201d was originally used to refer to a political system in South Africa which explicitly enforced racial segregation, and the domination and oppression of one racial group by another. It has since been adopted by the international community to condemn and criminalize such systems and practices wherever they occur in the world.\n**The crime against humanity of apartheid under the Apartheid Convention, the Rome Statute and customary international law is committed when any inhuman or inhumane act (essentially a serious human rights violation) is perpetrated in the context of an institutionalised regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over another, with the intention to maintain that system**.\nApartheid can best be understood as a system of prolonged and cruel discriminatory treatment by one racial group of members of another with the intention to control the second racial group.\n**Amnesty International has created a free 90-minute course called \u201cDeconstructing Israel\u2019s Apartheid Against Palestinians\u201d.** To learn more about the crime of apartheid in international law, what apartheid looks like in Israel/OPT, and how it affects Palestinians\u2019 lives, sign up to our course on Amnesty International\u2019s human rights education academy.\n!\nPalestinians wait to cross the Qalandia checkpoint between Ramallah and East Jerusalem, both in the occupied West Bank, as they head to...[Content truncated]",

He said no one was injured, including a UCPD officer who was assaulted with a crowbar while wearing a helmet.\nPolice officers from 20 different regional agencies were on the scene, according to Mogulof, including the California Highway Patrol, UC police from different campuses, Oakland, San Francisco, and agencies in the peninsula as far as Pacifica. The Berkeley police department, which isn\u2019t allowed to use tear gas and therefore cannot provide mutual aid to UCPD, was not on scene, Mayor Jesse Arregu\u00edn confirmed.\nWitnesses at the scene who shared information with Berkeleyside said at least 100 officers were in the area of Haste and Bowditch streets at 6 p.m., with barricades set up around the perimeter of the Southside neighborhood to prevent pedestrian and vehicle access.\nBarricades were set up at Channing Way and Bowditch Street, Channing Way and Telegraph Avenue, Dwight Way and Bowditch Street, Dwight Way and Telegraph Avenue and Haste Street and Telegraph Avenue.\nAs of 7 p.m., witnesses said officers had begun arrests. The university sent an alert at 6:37 p.m. to the campus community to avoid the area due to police activity.\nOfficers disposed of some tents that had been propped up on the front lawn of the hall, according to a witness.\n!\nWorkers clear out the lawn in front of the Anna Head building, where protesters propped up tents in protest, May 16, 2024.

Graffiti from the protest showed \u201cavenge al Shifa\u201d and \u201ca good soldier is a dead one\u201d spray-painted on boards.\nUnlike the three-week-long \u201cFree Palestine Camp\u201d protest on the university campus, activists at the occupation did not appear to have shared a public list of demands.\nThe previous camp, which initially started to draw attention to Israel\u2019s...[Content truncated]",

One banner hung from the building declared the site \"Alex Odeh Hall,\" in honour of a Palestinian activist who was killed in a 1985 office bombing in the nearby city of Santa Ana.\n*   \n*   \nFour nearby research buildings with potentially hundreds of people inside were locked down,...[Content truncated]",
