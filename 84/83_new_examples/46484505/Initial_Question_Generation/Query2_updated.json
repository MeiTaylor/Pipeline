It also has been 25 years since a fashion model took a ride on the roller coaster that he probably would like to forget (but never will).\nOn March 30, 1999, Fabio was on hand at the theme park to celebrate Apollo's Chariot's grand opening. \u00a0He took the front seat for the inaugural voyage, along with a bevy of young maidens.\nBut on the ride's very first drop, Fabio found himself with a face full of feathers and a bloody nose in need of stitches.\nA 10-pound goose found its way in the path of the coaster and -- at a speed of about 70 miles per hour -- landed squarely in the Italian model's face. Miraculously, Fabio's injuries were minor and while his maidens were shocked, they were otherwise unhurt.\n, the goose was not so lucky. It died on impact.\nFabio took it all in stride at the time, with even his publicist calling it \"a testament of the man's strength.\" But a few weeks later he went on Good Morning America to warn people about the dangers of Apollo's Chariot.\n\"It was not a freak accident, and it's going to happen again,\" Fabio said. \u00a0\"A person -- or even a child -- can be killed.\"\nIn a statement at the time, Busch Gardens apologized to Fabio about the accident and said that \"safety is our number one priority, and our ride engineers are examining ways to enhance the safety of an already safe ride.\"\nAnd despite Fabio's misgivings, it now does appear his \"goosing\" was indeed an isolated mishap. \u00a0No further incidents involving the ride and errant birds have occurred since the attraction opened.\nLater on that same day while Fabio was nursing his bloodied nose, our reporter Joe Flanagan fearlessly got on the ride for the first time. Indeed, Joe's experience on Apollo's Chariot is much more the norm for riders than the feathery fate Fabio encountered on that day in 1999:\n**RELATED: **\n**RELATED: **\n**RELATED: **\n_**Follow 13News Now on  and **_**_  \n\u25ba Make it easy to keep up to date with more stories like this. ._**\nClose Ad\nBefore You Leave, Check This Out\n--------------------------------\n!\n!\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n\u00a9 202...[Content truncated]",

In Greek mythology, Apollo was one of the most important and complex Gods. Fabio, an Italian fashion model, seemed like the perfect celebrity who resembled a Greek God. On March 30, 1999, a 10-pound goose struck Fabio in the face on the coaster's inaugural run.\nIn the past two weeks,  has referenced the incident on his podcasts. But he's been possibly spreading misinformation because, according to an interview, **the goose didn't hit Fabio**. In a , Fabio states that a goose hit the video camera, and a piece of debris slashed the bridge of Fabio's nose.\nHere\u2019s the full quote, slightly edited, from Fabio himself:\n> They built the fastest roller coaster in the world, but when they built it, they built it on a flying path of geese. So the geese, they have to fly into the roller coaster to get into the pond, and fly out of the roller coaster and get out of the pond.\n> \n> This is the twist: one of the...[Content truncated]",

While it does hint that a collision involving a goose occurred, it insinuates that the goose did not directly hit Fabio; rather, it was debris from the impact. This creates ambiguity regarding the specifics of the incident, slightly weakening its relevance, though it remains significant for context."

America lost its innocence.\nBy Published: Mar 30, 2018 9:42 AM EDT\n!Save Article\n!]\nSteve Eearly, The Virginian-Pilot\nNineteen years ago today, everything changed.\nFor those of us who came of age in the late 1990s, it was our Shot Heard 'Round The World, our Day The Music Died, our Secret Handjob At The First Lollapalooza. In an era rife with divisiveness and scandal\u2014Whitewater, the O. J. Simpson (excuse me, the \"somebody else\") murders, JonBenet Ramsey, Carrot Top\u2014only this brush with national tragedy truly changed how we live now.\nYep, you guessed it: on March 30, 1999, male supermodel/margarine spokesman Fabio killed a goose in mid-air with his face. We've been reeling from the aftershocks ever since.\n!\nFabio, (whose last name is Lanzoni, but we didn't know that then and we certainly don't need to know it now) wasn't at Busch Gardens Williamsburg in Virginia to kill a goose; he was there to take a front row seat for the inaugural ride on Apollo's Chariot, the theme park's first \".\" Apollo's Chariot was\u2014and is\u2014a thing of towering beauty, the likes of which Virginians hadn't seen. And the park's promoters knew that they couldn't settle for anything less than Fabio to lead its first charge.\nFabio was, and remains, a professional\u2014you don't pose for the covers of hundreds of romance novels by showing up to a gig without a clue\u2014but even he couldn't have prepared for what lay ahead. What, was he going to wear a helmet and cover that chiseled face, all that flowing hair? No, Fabio boarded Apollo's Chariot like a more handsome version of everyone else, soaking in the momentousness of the event as part of a group, stepping down from his golden pedestal to be with \"the people.\"\nA thing about hypercoasters (really, the main thing): they get really high up in the air. Not so high that your ears pop or you have small planes rerouting around you, but still: pretty high. A hypercoaster takes its passengers 200 feet or more above the ground, after which it drops them hard and fast...[Content truncated]",

But it was far from the first avian interruption on a ride. The greatest day of infamy remains Fabio\u2019s fatal collision with a goose.\nThe  took place on March 30, 1999, when the actor and model best known for gracing the covers of countless romance novels visited Busch Gardens Williamsburg in Virginia to promote Apollo\u2019s Chariot, a new roller coaster that stood a towering 210 feet tall.\nOwing to its considerable height, the coaster\u2019s flight pattern seemed to be at odds with that of native birds. Descending after the first big drop, it was  that a 10-pound goose suddenly materialized in front of Fabio\u2019s face, bloodying him and then expiring as a result of the midair collision.\nSince the opening was meant to be publicized, photographers were on hand to capture a bloodied Fabio as the coaster came to a stop. While it looked like a lot of blood\u2014and staunching the flow wasn\u2019t helped by the coaster inverting\u2014Fabio  only three stitches.\nWith the coaster going at a brisk 73 miles per hour, it appeared as though the goose could have mortally wounded Fabio. But Roger McWilliams, a physics professor at UC Irvine,  that momentum transfer likely spared the model\u2019s life.\n\"Since the goose is mushy, it could squash and diffuse the impact \u2026 like a crush zone in a car,\" he said. \"However, if it had been a brick, Fabio would be the crush zone.\"\nYears later, Fabio would contest this version of events,...[Content truncated]",

He was taken away in a limo to the hospital for a few minor cuts.\nThe goose \u2026 unfortunately did not survive.\nYou can watch the original story WAVY did back in 1999 above.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

That\u2019s because we alone have the ability to selflessly act when another is in danger, even if it means putting ourselves in harm\u2019s way. It is a beautiful trait, one entirely unique to mankind. But on an early spring day 16 years ago, I betrayed my own humanity with an act of extreme cowardice:\nI saw Fabio get hit in the face by a goose while riding a roller coaster. And I did nothing.\nThe day is burned into my memory. It was March 30, 1999, and international modeling superstar Fabio happened to be at Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, VA for a publicity appearance at the opening of its new coaster, Apollo\u2019s Chariot.

(WAVY) \u2014 Wednesday is a special day in Hampton Roads, the commemoration of one of the weirdest, most iconic moments in the region\u2019s history.\nOn March 30, 1999, Italian model and actor Fabio Lanzoni, best known as just Fabio, was hit by a goose as he helped celebrate the opening of the Apollo\u2019s Chariot rollercoaster in Busch Gardens Williamsburg\u2019s Italy section.\nComedian Jay Leno called it a \u201ccollision between birdbrains.\u201d\nFabio would be fine, but when the coaster came back to the cameras at the end of the ride there was Fabio, dejected and with a bloody face. He was taken away in a limo to the hospital for a few minor cuts.\nThe goose \u2026 unfortunately did not survive.\nYou can watch the original story WFXR\u2019s sister station, WAVY, did back in 1999 above.",
