In Greek mythology, Apollo was one of the most important and complex Gods. Fabio, an Italian fashion model, seemed like the perfect celebrity who resembled a Greek God. On March 30, 1999, a 10-pound goose struck Fabio in the face on the coaster's inaugural run.\nIn the past two weeks,  has referenced the incident on his podcasts. But he's been possibly spreading misinformation because, according to an interview, **the goose didn't hit Fabio**. In a , Fabio states that a goose hit the video camera, and a piece of debris slashed the bridge of Fabio's nose.\nHere‚Äôs the full quote, slightly edited, from Fabio himself:\n> They built the fastest roller coaster in the world, but when they built it, they built it on a flying path of geese. So the geese, they have to fly into the roller coaster to get into the pond, and fly out of the roller coaster and get out of the pond.\n> \n> This is the twist: one of the...[Content truncated]",

It also has been 25 years since a fashion model took a ride on the roller coaster that he probably would like to forget (but never will).\nOn March 30, 1999, Fabio was on hand at the theme park to celebrate Apollo's Chariot's grand opening. ¬†He took the front seat for the inaugural voyage, along with a bevy of young maidens.\nBut on the ride's very first drop, Fabio found himself with a face full of feathers and a bloody nose in need of stitches.\nA 10-pound goose found its way in the path of the coaster and -- at a speed of about 70 miles per hour -- landed squarely in the Italian model's face. Miraculously, Fabio's injuries were minor and while his maidens were shocked, they were otherwise unhurt.\n, the goose was not so lucky. It died on impact.\nFabio took it all in stride at the time, with even his publicist calling it \"a testament of the man's strength.\" But a few weeks later he went on Good Morning America to warn people about the dangers of Apollo's Chariot.\n\"It was not a freak accident, and it's going to happen again,\" Fabio said. ¬†\"A person -- or even a child -- can be killed.\"\nIn a statement at the time, Busch Gardens apologized to Fabio about the accident and said that \"safety is our number one priority, and our ride engineers are examining ways to enhance the safety of an already safe ride.\"\nAnd despite Fabio's misgivings, it now does appear his \"goosing\" was indeed an isolated mishap. ¬†No further incidents involving the ride and errant birds have occurred since the attraction opened.\nLater on that same day while Fabio was nursing his bloodied nose, our reporter Joe Flanagan fearlessly got on the ride for the first time. Indeed, Joe's experience on Apollo's Chariot is much more the norm for riders than the feathery fate Fabio encountered on that day in 1999:\n**RELATED: **\n**RELATED: **\n**RELATED: **\n_**Follow 13News Now on  and **_**_  \n‚ñ∫ Make it easy to keep up to date with more stories like this. ._**\nClose Ad\nBefore You Leave, Check This Out\n--------------------------------\n!\n!\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n¬© 202...[Content truncated]",

It also has been 25 years since a fashion model took a ride on the roller coaster that he probably would like to forget (but never will).\nOn March 30, 1999, Fabio was on hand at the theme park to celebrate Apollo's Chariot's grand opening. ¬†He took the front seat for the inaugural voyage, along with a bevy of young maidens.\nBut on the ride's very first drop, Fabio found himself with a face full of feathers and a bloody nose in need of stitches.\nA 10-pound goose found its way in the path of the coaster and -- at a speed of about 70 miles per hour -- landed squarely in the Italian model's face. Miraculously, Fabio's injuries were minor and while his maidens were shocked, they were otherwise unhurt.\n, the goose was not so lucky. It died on impact.\nFabio took it all in stride at the time, with even his publicist calling it \"a testament of the man's strength.\" But a few weeks later he went on Good Morning America to warn people about the dangers of Apollo's Chariot.\n\"It was not a freak accident, and it's going to happen again,\" Fabio said. ¬†\"A person -- or even a child -- can be killed.\"\nIn a statement at the time, Busch Gardens apologized to Fabio about the accident and said that \"safety is our number one priority, and our ride engineers are examining ways to enhance the safety of an already safe ride.\"\nAnd despite Fabio's misgivings, it now does appear his \"goosing\" was indeed an isolated mishap. ¬†No further incidents involving the ride and errant birds have occurred since the attraction opened.\nLater on that same day while Fabio was nursing his bloodied nose, our reporter Joe Flanagan fearlessly got on the ride for the first time. Indeed, Joe's experience on Apollo's Chariot is much more the norm for riders than the feathery fate Fabio encountered on that day in 1999:\n**RELATED: **\n**RELATED: **\n**RELATED: **\n_**Follow 13News Now on  and **_**_  \n‚ñ∫ Make it easy to keep up to date with more stories like this. ._**\nClose Ad\nBefore You Leave, Check This Out\n--------------------------------\n!\n!\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n¬© 202...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "Was the incident of Fabio being hit by a goose on the roller coaster officially reported?",
        "Answer": "Yes, the incident of Fabio being hit by a goose while riding a roller coaster was officially reported. This incident occurred on March 29, 1999, at Busch Gardens Williamsburg during the grand opening of the Apollo's Chariot roller coaster. Reports state that a goose flew into Fabio's face while he was in the front seat, leading to a cut on his nose and some blood, although his injuries were minor compared to the fate of the goose, which did not survive the collision. In a retrospective account, Fabio himself addressed the incident and noted that most people have the story wrong, stating, \"I was never hit by the goose,\" but he acknowledged the event as significant and a \"freak accident\" that could have had worse consequences. Various articles from credible news sources have documented this accident, confirming that it was widely covered in the media at the time and remains a notable event in amusement park history.",
