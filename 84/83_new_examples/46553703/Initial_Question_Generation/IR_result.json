In Read's application, which was granted the following year, she cited that \"it is well known that a great many difficulties rise in raising and properly housing babies and small children in crowded cities, that is to say from the health viewpoint.\" The solution she proposed was as follows:\nWith these facts in view it is the purpose of the present invention to provide an article of manufacture for babies and young children, to be suspended upon the exterior of a building adjacent an open window, wherein the baby or young child may be placed. This article of manufacture comprises a housing or cage, wherein the baby or young child together with proper toys may be placed.\nA similar product makes an appearance in Louis Fischer's 1920 book The Health-Care of the Baby, which describes \"a convenient outdoor sleeping compartment readily attached to any window,\" called the Boggins’ Window Crib. The wire device, 36\" x 24\" x 27\", is described as being \"admirably adapted for city apartments,\" with an insulated roof that will keep the baby cool enough to build up a cold-weather tolerance even in summer.\nAlthough patented in the early 1920s in the States, it wasn’t till the '30s that these cages took off—and in smog-filled London, of all places. The wire cages were attached to tenant buildings and distributed to members of the Chelsea Baby Club who lived in high buildings without garden space in which to air their babies.\nThe fad proved to have some staying power, and in 1953, British Pathé produced this pun-filled promotional video espousing the benefits of baby cages.\n\nIt's not entirely clear when exactly the baby cage's popularity began to wane, but it likely had something to do with growing concerns for child safety in the second half of the 20th century. But if it still seems like a great idea to you, these days there are similar options for cats.\n[h/t Apartment Therapy and Gothamist]\n© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved",

She doesn't spell it out, but Emma Read was a forward-thinking woman: If the patent had taken off and baby cages been installed all over big cities, the roof would have also served to protect the baby from anything that fell from the wire floor of the cage above.\n**Explore the complete  archive.**\n!\n_Image: 1.

        "Question": "Is it true that the baby cage was patented in 1922 for urban toddlers' fresh air?",
        "Answer": "Yes, it is true that the baby cage was patented in 1922 as a solution for providing urban toddlers with fresh air. The invention was created to address the health concerns of raising children in crowded city environments, where traditional outdoor spaces such as gardens were often unavailable. The baby cage, also referred to as a \"health cage,\" was designed by Mrs. Robert C. Lafferty and later a patent application was filed by Emma Read from Spokane, Washington, for a device that could be suspended from apartment windows, allowing babies to receive sunlight and fresh air while safely enclosed in a wire cage. This innovative approach was believed to help promote the health of babies living in urban settings, where the importance of fresh air and ventilation was becoming increasingly recognized. Moreover, documents indicate that this concept gained traction in places like London in the 1930s, where it was embraced by local organizations, such as the Chelsea Baby Club, despite never becoming widespread in its adoption. The cage also included features like removable curtains and could double as a bed, further showcasing its multipurpose design intended to aid urban parents.",
