We donât know a lot. As the video above shows, many baby cages appeared in London in the 1930s, where they appeared to be embraced by some city councils, as well as by the Chelsea Baby Club, a child care organization that distributed the cages around the city. Later, some British architects  the âbaby balconiesâ into their designs for middle-class homes.\nThe phenomenon was never particularly widespread, though it was common enough in 1953 that the news film service British PathÃ© made a film about the trend (meaning that baby cages were reinstalled even after the World War II blitz on London).\nWhere did this completely reasonable idea come from?\n----------------------------------------------------\nOur best guess is that baby cages were inspired by a desire to give city kids some fresh air. Thatâs in line with the philosophy of Emma Read, a Spokane, Washington, woman who invented one of the first . As she wrote in her patent application, her dream was to give babies an escape from crowded urban environments ... by suspending them in a cage over crowded urban environments.\nBeyond that, we can only guess at the intellectual climate that made baby cages seem appealing. It can probably be attributed, in part, to the growth of American cities in the 20th century, where babies had to get outdoor time any way they could.\nSome trace the outdoor focus to eminent pediatrician , who held a position at the Rockefeller Foundation and whose influential 1897 book, , recommended plenty of sunlight and fresh air for babies. Holt believed that with fresh air âthe appetite is improved, the digestion is better, the cheeks become red, and all signs of health are seen.â People listened: In 1904, parents were already .\nWe donât know if Read or the Chelsea Baby Club were inspired by Holt, but as an influential early pediatrician, he reflected an appreciation of fresh air that was, probably, in the air. So that meant putting babies in the air, too.\nWatch the above video to learn the history of the baby cage. You can find this video and all of .

In honor of the upcoming West Texas âsnowmageddonâ I thought Iâd share a story featured in the February 2018 issue of _Digging History Magazine_. Enjoy!\nThis article may very well make you think, âyou must be kidding! Seriously?â\nTo begin with I came upon this story in a rather roundabout way. So, in a roundabout way let me explain. It started with a Christmas sermon about Baby Jesus and how the manger (a feeding trough) served as his crib. The minister explained that in those days there was no such thing as a crib as we know it today. Interestingly, the Old English word âcribâ means âmangerâ or âstallâ.\nHowever, it wasnât until sometime in the nineteenth century when baby cribs came into use. Where did the little one sleep before the 1800s? Though it sounds ill-advised today, children often slept with their mother.\nA primary feature of the crib was the ability to keep the child from falling out of bed...[Content truncated]",

The patent also notes that the cage could double as a place to sleep, with removable curtains working to prevent a draft.\n\"It is well known that a great many difficulties rise in raising and properly housing babies and small children in crowded cities, that is to say from the health viewpoint,\" the patent, which was finally granted on March 13, 1923, reads. \"With these facts in view it is the purpose of the present invention to provide an article of manufacture for babies and young children, to be suspended upon the exterior of a building adjacent an open window, wherein the baby or young child may be placed.\"\nThe figures associated with the patent show a cage similar to that seen in the pictures, but with a slanted, overlapping roof piece said to protect the babies locked inside from rain or snow. She doesn't spell it out, but Emma Read was a forward-thinking woman: If the patent had taken off and baby cages been installed all over big cities, the roof would have also served to protect the baby from anything that fell from the wire floor of the cage above.\n**Explore the complete  archive.**\n!\n_Image: 1.

In Read's application, which was granted the following year, she cited that \"it is well known that a great many difficulties rise in raising and properly housing babies and small children in crowded cities, that is to say from the health viewpoint.\" The solution she proposed was as follows:\nWith these facts in view it is the purpose of the present invention to provide an article of manufacture for babies and young children, to be suspended upon the exterior of a building adjacent an open window, wherein the baby or young child may be placed. This article of manufacture comprises a housing or cage, wherein the baby or young child together with proper toys may be placed.\nA similar product makes an appearance inÂ Louis Fischer's 1920 book The Health-Care of the Baby, which describes \"a convenient outdoor sleeping compartment readily attached to any window,\" called the Bogginsâ Window Crib. The wire device, 36\" x 24\" x 27\", is described as being \"admirably adapted for city apartments,\" with an insulated roof that will keep the baby cool enough to build up a cold-weather tolerance even in summer.\nAlthough patented in the early 1920sÂ in the States, it wasnât till the '30s that these cages took offâand in smog-filled London, of all places. The wire cages were attached to tenant buildings and distributed to members of the Chelsea Baby Club who lived in high buildings without garden space in which to air their babies.\nThe fad proved to have some staying power, and in 1953, British PathÃ© produced this pun-filled promotional video espousing the benefits of baby cages.\n\nIt's not entirely clear when exactly the baby cage's popularity began to wane, but it likely had something to do with growing concerns for child safety in the second half of the 20th century. But if it still seems like a great idea to you, these days there are similar options for cats.\n[h/t Apartment Therapy and Gothamist]\nÂ© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved",
