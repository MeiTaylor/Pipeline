But from the 1920s through the ’50s, there was another option.\nThat option was to hang a cage from your window and put a baby in it.\nSo what was the deal with these baby cages? We don’t know a lot. As the video above shows, many baby cages appeared in London in the 1930s, where they appeared to be embraced by some city councils, as well as by the Chelsea Baby Club, a child care organization that distributed the cages around the city. Later, some British architects  the “baby balconies” into their designs for middle-class homes.\nThe phenomenon was never particularly widespread, though it was common enough in 1953 that the news film service British Pathé made a film about the trend (meaning that baby cages were reinstalled even after the World War II blitz on London).\nWhere did this completely reasonable idea come from?\n----------------------------------------------------\nOur best guess is that baby cages were inspired by a desire to give city kids some fresh air. That’s in line with the philosophy of Emma Read, a Spokane, Washington, woman who invented one of the first . As she wrote in her patent application, her dream was to give babies an escape from crowded urban environments ... by suspending them in a cage over crowded urban environments.\nBeyond that, we can only guess at the intellectual climate that made baby cages seem appealing. It can probably be attributed, in part, to the growth of American cities in the 20th century, where babies had to get outdoor time any way they could.\nSome trace the outdoor focus to eminent pediatrician , who held a position at the Rockefeller Foundation and whose influential 1897 book, , recommended plenty of sunlight and fresh air for babies. Holt believed that with fresh air “the appetite is improved, the digestion is better, the cheeks become red, and all signs of health are seen.” People listened: In 1904, parents were already .\nWe...[Content truncated]",

For instance, on December 4, 1888 David J. Powers was awarded U.S. Patent 394010 for a crib or child’s bed. Powers explained:\n_]My improved child’s crib is preferably constructed with a frame having sufficient high sides, upon which the folding panels are hinged to permit the panels to fold down_.\nAfter these types of cribs were invented and improved upon there were other devices, with accompanying theories of proper child-rearing, which began to pop up in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Here’s a depiction of a “baby cage” invented by Emma Read of Spokane, Washington in 1922 and patented (#1448235) the following year.\n]If the image looks a little odd just sort of hanging out there, it’s because it was designed to hang that way – outside a window! These cages began to take off in the 1930s, especially in London (not exactly the healthiest air quality in the world at that time).  The July 1953 issue of _Popular Mechanics_ depicted a baby cage accompanied with a description of its purpose:\n**]Apartment-Window Cage Protects English Tots**  \n_Enclosed in a wire cage suspended from an apartment window, English children play in the sunlight and fresh air while their mothers are busy with housework. The cage, made of wire netting, is strongly braced and is guarded on the apartment side by a cloth net which prevents children from crawling back into the room. Loaned by an infant welfare center to families with no gardens, the portable balcony is apparently popular with children and mothers. The demand exceeds the supply_.\nThe idea of “airing” one’s baby came about in the late nineteenth century as Dr. Luther Emmett Holt explained the concept in his 1894 book, The Care and Feeding of Children. In a chapter entitled “Airing” Holt wrote:\n_Of what advantage to the child is going out? Fresh air is required to renew and purify the blood, and this is just as necessary for health and growth as proper food._\n_What are the effects produced in infants by fresh air? The appetite is improved, the digestion is better, the cheeks become red, and all signs of health are seen. . ._\n_What are the objections to an infant’s sleeping out of doors? There are no real objections. It is not true that infants take cold more easily...[Content truncated]",

Perhaps you roamed aimlessly around the neighborhood until dinner, or rode in a not-so-secure carseat (or, if you were really lucky, a \"\").\nBut new parents from a generation or two ago had nothing on the daring London moms of the 1930s: They literally hung their babies out the window.\nDangling \"baby cages\" came into vogue after they were invented in 1922, but  that their origin really began with the 1884 book , by Dr. Luther Emmett. In his book, Emmett carefully describes how babies need to be \"aired\" (you know, like a musty rug) to \"renew and purify the blood.\"\nBut whatever was a doting, apartment-living mom to do? Responding to a lack of homes with outdoor space, some London communities began outfitting windows with infant-sized cages for babies to hang out in.\nAs anyone who's searched for a city apartment surely knows, a terrace or deck can be quite the find. But these menacing, chicken coop-like bins remind us of a misleading real estate listing — not exactly what you (or your infant) had in mind.\nTake a look:\n!]\nMedia Platforms Design Team\n!]\nMedia...[Content truncated]",

In Read's application, which was granted the following year, she cited that \"it is well known that a great many difficulties rise in raising and properly housing babies and small children in crowded cities, that is to say from the health viewpoint.\" The solution she proposed was as follows:\nWith these facts in view it is the purpose of the present invention to provide an article of manufacture for babies and young children, to be suspended upon the exterior of a building adjacent an open window, wherein the baby or young child may be placed. This article of manufacture comprises a housing or cage, wherein the baby or young child together with proper toys may be placed.\nA similar product makes an appearance in Louis Fischer's 1920 book The Health-Care of the Baby, which describes \"a convenient outdoor sleeping compartment readily attached to any window,\" called the Boggins’ Window Crib. The wire device, 36\" x 24\" x 27\", is described as being \"admirably adapted for city apartments,\" with an insulated roof that will keep the baby cool enough to build up a cold-weather tolerance even in summer.\nAlthough patented in the early 1920s in the States, it wasn’t till the '30s that these cages took off—and in smog-filled London, of all places. The wire cages were attached to tenant buildings and distributed to members of the Chelsea Baby Club who lived in high buildings without garden space in which to air their babies.\nThe fad proved to have some staying power, and in 1953, British Pathé produced this pun-filled promotional video espousing the benefits of baby cages.\n\nIt's not entirely clear when exactly the baby cage's popularity began to wane, but it likely had something to do with growing concerns for child safety in the second half of the 20th century. But if it still seems like a great idea to you, these days there are similar options for cats.\n[h/t Apartment Therapy and Gothamist]\n© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved",

Besides the usual foxes, skunks, raccoons, and other wildlife, we have a colony of feral cats in the woods behind our house and a domesticated cat next door with feline AIDS. Plus our little gal’s only seven and a half pounds fully grown. She’d be outmatched in a fight.\n \nThe problem is, she LOVES being outside. It’s obvious her previous owners who gave her up (pregnant and unvaccinated) let her go out whenever she wanted. In nice weather we bring her out to the backyard in her harness (which she can easily slip out of, even the smallest one we could find), and we give her plenty of inside window perches. She loves both, but we know she’s pining for more. So I started looking at protective outdoor options, including a deep, screened-in window box. These, along with larger, screened enclosures for the outdoors have become known as catios: “cat” + “patio.”\nIn one of the articles about these window enclosures, it mentioned that similar contraptions were used for babies in the 1930-50s.\nHuh? Was that really a thing? I mean, I grew up in an age where moms held their babies in their laps during car rides, seat belts were optional (and air bags? ABS? Lane departure alert? Sci-fi stuff), kids roamed the streets unsupervised until dinnertime, and parents took their kids on chickenpox play dates, so hey, anything’s possible. I did a bit of poking around.\nIt turns out that, yes, they were used, but not widely, and mostly in high-rise London tenements in the 1930s. (By the way, there’s no evidence of any reported deaths from these things. Whew). Emma Reed in 1922 applied for a patent for her own design.\nI’d love to be able to show you the pics, but they are all copyrighted. However, here’s a British Pathe clip about baby cages. Looks like it was filmed in the post-war ’40s or early ’50s, I can’t confirm the date. Be warned, it’s kinda corny, with a gazillion goofy puns:\n\nBut why suspend babies in cages out the window in the first place?\nI had the same question!\nThe answer is an intriguing one, and led me back to the time period...[Content truncated]",
