The original image - of the Waiola Church in Lahaina in flames on 8 August - has no laser beam or ray of light visible.\nTwo other false images have been racking up huge numbers of views.\nOne shows a fireball and a bright streak of light rising up towards the night sky.

The original image - of the Waiola Church in Lahaina in flames on 8 August - has no laser beam or ray of light visible.\nTwo other false images have been racking up huge numbers of views.\nOne shows a fireball and a bright streak of light rising up towards the night sky. It, too, has been accompanied by claims that wildfires are not a natural phenomenon. \nBut a search on the internet for previous versions of this image reveals the photo shows a controlled burn at an Ohio oil refinery, external and was first posted online in January 2018, external. The streak of light, known as a \"light pillar\", is an optical illusion formed by reflections off ice crystals on a cold day, external.\nA similar image claims to show a huge beam of light in Maui just before the wildfires. But it shows the launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in California, external in May 2018.\nThere are claims circulating about videos from Maui showing some trees still standing while houses and vehicles have been burned, with people pointing to the pictures as \"evidence\" that the fires were deliberately set or that their real cause is being hidden from the public.\nOne post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, includes a video of the destruction and the message: \"Everything is burnt but the trees, but don't...[Content truncated]",

(PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images)\nAs firefighters on the island of Maui continue to battle flare ups from the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century, conspiracy theorists on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and in particular Twitter, are spreading claims that the U.S. government used directed energy weapons to cause the deadly blazes in order to turn Maui into a “smart island.”\nThe posts have racked up tens of millions of views and many of them remain on the platforms without any warning that the claims being made in them are entirely false.\nWhile the claims about the government seeking to create a smart island or turn the fire-razed city of Lahaina into a 15-minute city are new, the idea that laser weapon systems developed by the government have been used to start the wildfires are nothing new, dating back to at least the devastating wildfires that \nThese claims merge two distinct conspiracy narratives: a deep distrust of governments, and claims that undermine the role of climate change in the dramatic increase in .\nThe fires in Maui began on August 8 and have so far claimed the lives of 99 people, with 1,300 more still unaccounted for, making this the deadliest wildfire in the U.S. in a century. Authorities are still investigating the cause of the fire, but there is no evidence so far that they were started deliberately. But almost as soon as they began, social media users were making up wild allegations about the origins of the deadly blazes. One Instagram video posted on August 11 shows footage from the aftermath of the fires, with the narrator claiming it looks like the aftermath of a bomb being detonated. It has racked up millions of views on Instagram and on other platforms where it has been reposted.\nOn X, where much of the conspiracies have been spread, video claiming to show a “direct energy weapon” or DEW being fired in Maui was viewed 10 million times before a Community Note was added pointing out that the footage actually showed a transformer explosion in Chile earlier this year.\nAnother post on X showed what appeared to be a laser beam pointing at a burning church in Maui, but a review of the original image taken by an Associated Press photographer shows the image had been doctored. That post racked up 9 million views.\nClaims that DEWs have been deployed to purposely begin fires can be traced back at least six years. In...[Content truncated]",

The platform flagged the post with a warning that read, \"Image captures an event that occurred in Michigan in 2018, not a current event in Hawaii.\"\n\"The Directed Energy Weapons (DEWs) being used on Hawaii are powerful enough to set the Pacific Ocean on fire,\" far-right online personality Stew Peters said.\nDEWs involve \"high energy lasers and other high power electromagnetics\" that \"use concentrated electromagnetic energy to combat enemy forces and assets,\" according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO).\nAlthough the Defense Department has spent $1 billion annually on developing these weapons to take down missile and drone threats, an April 2023 GAO report says the department has had trouble deploying these technologies outside of labs because of a lack of transition planning.\n!
