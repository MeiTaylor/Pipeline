(PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images)\nAs firefighters on the island of Maui continue to battle flare ups from the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century, conspiracy theorists on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and in particular Twitter, are spreading claims that the U.S. government used directed energy weapons to cause the deadly blazes in order to turn Maui into a “smart island.”\nThe posts have racked up tens of millions of views and many of them remain on the platforms without any warning that the claims being made in them are entirely false.\nWhile the claims about the government seeking to create a smart island or turn the fire-razed city of Lahaina into a 15-minute city are new, the idea that laser weapon systems developed by the government have been used to start the wildfires are nothing new, dating back to at least the devastating wildfires that \nThese claims merge two distinct conspiracy narratives: a deep distrust of governments, and claims that undermine the role of climate change in the dramatic increase in .\nThe fires in Maui began on August 8 and have so far claimed the lives of 99 people, with 1,300 more still unaccounted for, making this the deadliest wildfire in the U.S. in a century. Authorities are still investigating the cause of the fire, but there is no evidence so far that they were started deliberately. But almost as soon as they began, social media users were making up wild allegations about the origins of the deadly blazes. One Instagram video posted on August 11 shows footage from the aftermath of the fires, with the narrator claiming it looks like the aftermath of a bomb being detonated. It has racked up millions of views on Instagram and on other platforms where it has been reposted.\nOn X, where much of the conspiracies have been spread, video claiming to show a “direct energy weapon” or DEW being fired in Maui was viewed 10 million times before a Community Note was added pointing out that the footage actually showed a transformer explosion in Chile earlier this year.\nAnother post on X showed what appeared to be a laser beam pointing at a burning church in Maui, but a review of the original image taken by an Associated Press photographer shows the image had been doctored. That post racked up 9 million views.\nClaims that DEWs have been deployed to purposely begin fires can be traced back at least six years. In...[Content truncated]",

            "content": "An aerial image taken on August 10, 2023 shows destroyed homes and buildings burned to the ground in Lahaina in the aftermath of wildfires in western Maui, Hawaii. (PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images)\nAs firefighters on the island of Maui continue to battle flare ups from the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century, conspiracy theorists on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and in particular Twitter, are spreading claims that the U.S. government used directed energy weapons to cause the deadly blazes in order to turn Maui into a “smart island.”\nThe posts have racked up tens of millions of views and many of them remain on the platforms without any warning that the claims being made in them are entirely false.\nWhile the claims about the government seeking to create a smart island or turn the fire-razed city of Lahaina into a 15-minute city are new, the idea that laser weapon systems developed by the government have been used to start the wildfires are nothing new, dating back to at least the devastating wildfires that \nThese claims merge two distinct conspiracy narratives: a deep distrust of governments, and claims that undermine the role of climate change in the dramatic increase in .\nThe fires in Maui began on August 8 and have so far claimed the lives of 99 people, with 1,300 more still unaccounted for, making this the deadliest wildfire in the U.S. in a century. Authorities are still investigating the cause of the fire, but there is no evidence so far that they were started deliberately. But almost as soon as they began, social media users were making up wild allegations about the origins of the deadly blazes. One Instagram video posted on August 11 shows footage from the aftermath of the fires, with the narrator claiming it looks like the aftermath of a bomb being detonated. It has racked up millions of views on Instagram and on other platforms where it has been reposted.\nOn X, where much of the conspiracies have been spread, video claiming to show a “direct energy weapon” or DEW being fired in Maui was viewed 10 million times before a Community Note was added pointing out that the footage actually showed a transformer explosion in Chile earlier this year.\nAnother post on X showed what appeared to be a laser beam pointing at a burning church in Maui, but a review of the original image taken by an Associated Press photographer shows the image had been doctored. That post racked up 9 million views.\nClaims that DEWs have been deployed to purposely begin fires can be traced back at least six years. In...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What evidence supports that the displayed light in the video was a directed energy weapon rather than a firework?",
        "Answer": "The claim that the displayed light in the video was a directed energy weapon rather than a firework is not supported by substantial evidence. In fact, various reports and investigations indicate that such claims are largely unfounded.\n\n1. **Misleading Claims about Directed Energy Weapons**: Many of the viral claims about directed energy weapons (DEWs) being responsible for the wildfires in Maui originate from a pattern of misinformation that typically follows major disasters. These claims often suggest that \"elites\" or government agencies orchestrated the fires and are not based on verifiable facts. For example, a BBC report highlighted that rumors about the wildfires being caused by a DEW were part of false narratives that emerged after the disasters [Query 2_evidence1].\n\n2. **False Interpretations of Video Evidence**: Specific videos purported to show explosions or odd light phenomena that were claimed to be DEWs have been debunked. One widely circulated video that allegedly showed a DEW firing was actually footage of a transformer explosion in Chile [Query 2_evidence3]. This misattribution is a common issue where videos from unrelated events are misused to support conspiracy theories.\n\n3. **Manipulated Images**: Some images claiming to show the destructive effects of a DEW, particularly one featuring a burning church in Lahaina, were found to be digitally altered. The original image did not contain any laser or beam of light, which undermines the argument that DEWs were used in the Maui fires [Query 2_evidence2].\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that the claims about directed energy weapons are part of a broader trend of misinformation, with no credible source confirming that the light depicted in the video was a DEW rather than a benign phenomenon like a firework.",
