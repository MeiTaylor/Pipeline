I didn’t need to be the bearer of good (bad? indifferent?) news, anyway!\nNah, actually, this is the part I think you and I both enjoy: looking at ships!\nJust like past versions of the Value Series on Mudd Choice Packs/MEGA Bundles (“Mudd Bundles”), I’ll use this part to show off the ships and give some historical perspective (as best as I’m aware of), while the 2nd part of this will look at the Zen- and cash-equivalent pricing of certain choices in this Bundle.\n**THE SHIPS**\nAs always, we’ll start with the ships! I’m going to do this one slightly differently. I’ll start off with the individual ships first, then I’ll hit the 3-pack of ships (the first time we’ve had a multiple-ship choice since “” in 2021 and only the 3rd overall Bundle to do so, the first being the original “” when ).\n\\*NOTE: Technically, all ships here are available for free via the yearly Event Campaigns. However, this will deal with the original and more regular way these ships come around.\n_****_\n!\n_ORIGINAL RELEASE METHOD:_  chance reward.\n_ORIGINAL RELEASE DATE:_ June 5th, 2018\n_ACCOUNT-WIDE RELEASE DATE:_ August 24th, 2023\n_TIME SPAN FROM SINGLE-CHARACTER TO ACCOUNT-WIDE:_ 5 Years, 2 Months, 20 Days\n_CLAIM(S) TO FAME:_ Final canon Jem’Hadar ship to make it to STO (as best I’m aware, anyway); Two Commander-level seats; If you’re picking this up for lack of better options, account-wide...[Content truncated]",

Also, where do you think Hollywood gets firearms wrong in science fiction movies?\n========================================================================================================================================================\nI'm doing some research and thought I'd see what ideas people here might have. I am looking at writing a screenplay for a science fiction short film in which there will be extensive firearms usage. I have my own ideas for features a future firearm might have:\n1.  caseless ammunition\n2.  DNA verifying palm reader\n3.  Wireless onboard computer that keeps track of the ammo count, time and location (GPS) of firing and other pertinent data. This would communicate with the owner's brain via something akin to a cellphone implant just behind the ear.\n4.  Built in laser targeting sight, much like we already have but smaller and built in, not an attachment.\nWhat are your thoughts? Thanks!\n**Edit**\nI forgot the stunner rounds. Imagine a bullet that does not penetrate the body but attaches (maybe with barbs) and acts as a mini-taser.\n**Edit 2: The Sequel**\nWow! This has turned into a great conversation. Thanks for all the fantastic comments!\nRead more\n**Top 1%** \nTop Posts\n---------\n* * *\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   &nbsp;\n*   &nbsp;\n* * *\n*   TOPICS\n*   Internet Culture (Viral)\n*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   \n*   Games\n*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   \n*   Q&As\n*   *   \n*   Technology\n*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   \n*   Pop Culture\n*   *   *   *   *   *   \n*   Movies & TV\n*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   \n* * *\n*   RESOURCES\n*   *   *   *   *   *   \n* * *\n*   *   *   \n* * *\n*   *   *   ",

Up until now, I've been calling my build DEWSci, but others have taken DEWSci in a different direction. DFS focuses on exotic damage as the primary damage source. This is different from some of the existing , which focus on energy weapon damage. As you read this guide, you will see the substantial differences in build choices.\nI've been theorizing such a build  , however the idea was not worthwhile until recently. Two major things have changed: The rise of 7 weapon + SecDef ships, and the Photonic Officer buff.\nWhy would you want to fly a DFS build? In short, it's incredibly fun. The mixture of space magic and obliterating everything in your forward arc is extremely satisfying. It's like flying two ships at once.\nThe five points of the damage formula\n-------------------------------------\nIn order to create a build that manages to combine two completely different damage styles, it's critical to understand how the damage formula works. I'm going to be breaking down five stats that directly impact damage output. Improving each of these is part of a successful build in STO.\n| 1: Subsystem Power: |\n| --- |\n| The most intuitive boost, subsystem power is very easy to understand...[Content truncated]",

I think, not just in terms of appearance, but also in terms of approach to character, stripping away years of very well-developed charisma to just try and inhabit the skin of a somewhat awkward, sometimes venal, but also charismatic individual, and losing himself in this utterly. And then as we come up to this door, we go into the Senate hearing rooms. And we try to give that as much visibility, grandeur, and glamour to contrast with the security hearing that’s so claustrophobic.

Robert Oppenheimer, the man known as “the father of the atomic bomb,” condenses a titanic shift in consciousness into three haunted hours. A drama about genius, hubris and error, both individual and collective, it brilliantly charts the turbulent life of the American theoretical physicist who helped research and develop the two atomic bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II — cataclysms that helped usher in our human-dominated age.\n### Listen to This Article\nThe movie is based on “: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” the authoritative 2005 biography by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Written and directed by Nolan, the film borrows liberally from the book as it surveys Oppenheimer’s life, including his role in the Manhattan Engineer District, better known as the Manhattan Project. He served as director of a clandestine weapons lab built in a near-desolate stretch of Los Alamos, in New Mexico, where he and many other of the era’s most dazzling scientific minds puzzled through how to harness nuclear reactions for the weapons that killed tens of thousands instantly, ending the war in the Pacific.\nThe atomic bomb and what it wrought define Oppenheimer’s legacy and also shape this film. Nolan goes deep and long on the building of the bomb, a fascinating and appalling process, but he doesn’t restage the attacks; there are no documentary images of the dead or panoramas of cities in ashes, decisions that read as his ethical absolutes.
