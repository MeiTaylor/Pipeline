She adds that the city plans include \"building a high-rise condo complex and business in Lahaina, which is a historic town that couldn't have any new development in the city area. But now it's demolished, so I guess they have to rebuild it.\"\n!\nNo official cause(s) of the 2023 Maui wildfires have been announced, but extreme weather conditions played a role.Image: Matthew A. Foster/U.S. Army National Guard/UPI Photo/Newscom/picture alliance\nClimate change is the official villain\n--------------------------------------\n\"The idea that something as trivial as a small fire can cause such damage by chance and through a chain of unfavorable circumstances is at first a scary and threatening thought,\" explains media psychologist Frischlich.\n\"Conspiracy theories give it a kind of meaning. If individual people are to blame, then yes, it would be enough to hold that person accountable, and then such terrible things can't happen anymore.\"\n**Conclusion:** All the images and videos presented as evidence that DEW attacks caused the August wildfires in Maui are false. The scenes are not from Maui, date back to 2018 and do not show DEW attacks.\nThough the causes of the Maui wildfires are still being investigated,  conditions certainly played a role, according to official sources: a combination of conditions including hot weather, strong winds, and drought since May.\n_Astrid Prange de Oliveira contributed to this report._",

                    "content": "Why This Matters\n----------------\nThere is a surge in interest in directed energy weapons from several nations—including the U.S.—primarily for counter drone missions. These weapons use electromagnetic energy to cause effects ranging from deterrence to destruction. They offer capabilities that conventional weapons may not, but challenges have so far prevented widespread operational use.\nThe Technology\n--------------\n**What is it?** Directed energy weapons (DEW) use concentrated electromagnetic energy to combat enemy forces and assets. These weapons include high energy lasers and other high power electromagnetics—such as millimeter wave and high power microwave weapons. Unlike weapons that fire bullets or missiles, DEWs can respond to a threat in different ways. For example, they can temporarily degrade electronics on a drone or physically destroy it. See our 2022  for more information on counter-drone technology.\n**How does it work?** Each type of DEW uses a different region of the electromagnetic spectrum (see fig. 1). This spectrum describes all of the kinds of light—including those the human eye cannot see—and classifies them according to wavelength. Different types of electromagnetic energy have different properties. For example, the wavelength affects what the directed energy can penetrate—such as metal or human skin.\n!\nFigure 1. Location of directed energy weapons on the electromagnetic spectrum.\nAll DEWs emit energy at the speed of light, and are often discussed in terms of their power output—the amount of electromagnetic energy transferred over time. While DEWs use electromagnetic energy similar to everyday items, such as household microwaves, their power output is vastly higher, as described below.\n**High energy lasers** produce a very narrow beam of light, usually in the infrared to visible region, and are typically used on one target at a time. The beam can be pulsed or continuous, generating a power output of at least 1 kilowatt. This output is 200,...[Content truncated]",

[+] aftermath of wildfires in western Maui in Lahaina, (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images)\nIf you search Twitter for information about the fires in Hawaii that have killed at least 67 people, you’re likely to find some wild conspiracy theories. In fact, a number of different verified accounts on Twitter, now officially known as X, insist space lasers are actually creating the fires in Maui—a ridiculous conspiracy theory that first gained widespread attention after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia floated the idea on Facebook in 2018.\nTo be clear, there’s absolutely no evidence that space lasers are to blame for the fires in Maui, which have destroyed at least 1,000 buildings and caused mass evacuations. But that hasn’t stopped many so-called verified accounts on Twitter from insisting that old photos actually depict lasers being shot from space in Hawaii.\nOne popular tweet that’s been viewed over 900,000 times has tried to suggest the photo below was captured showing a laser being shot at Hawaii.\n“This photo is circulating social media. Apparently this beam was captured before the Hawaii fires. Can anyone confirm?” the tweet from a verified account reads.\nTweet falsely suggesting the photo shows a laser beam that hit Hawaii before the fires in Maui.\nIn reality, the photo is from a 2019 SpaceX launch at Vandenberg Air Force Base (now known as a Space Force Base), which is located in California.\nThe image was probably popularized as being associated with lasers because it was posted to Reddit featuring a caption saying it looked like a laser. But obviously it was no such thing. Long-exposure take-off photos for space launches often look like that.\nReddit post from 2019 pointing out that a SpaceX launch looked like a laser...[Content truncated]",
