These weapons use electromagnetic energy to cause effects ranging from deterrence to destruction. They offer capabilities that conventional weapons may not, but challenges have so far prevented widespread operational use.\nThe Technology\n--------------\n**What is it?** Directed energy weapons (DEW) use concentrated electromagnetic energy to combat enemy forces and assets. These weapons include high energy lasers and other high power electromagnetics\u2014such as millimeter wave and high power microwave weapons. Unlike weapons that fire bullets or missiles, DEWs can respond to a threat in different ways. For example, they can temporarily degrade electronics on a drone or physically destroy it. See our 2022  for more information on counter-drone technology.\n**How does it work?** Each type of DEW uses a different region of the electromagnetic spectrum (see fig. 1). This spectrum describes all of the kinds of light\u2014including those the human eye cannot see\u2014and classifies them according to wavelength. Different types of electromagnetic energy have different properties. For example, the wavelength affects what the directed energy can penetrate\u2014such as metal or human skin.\n!\nFigure 1. Location of directed energy weapons on the electromagnetic spectrum.\nAll DEWs emit energy at the speed of light, and are often discussed in terms of their power output\u2014the amount of electromagnetic energy transferred over time. While DEWs use electromagnetic energy similar to everyday items, such as household microwaves, their...[Content truncated]",

Different types of energy weapons utilize separate regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as radiowaves and microwaves.\n, a spokesperson for the State of Hawaii Department of Defense, told USA TODAY in an email the cause of the fire is still being investigated, but there's no truth to the claim that energy weapons were involved.\nJohn Winn, a spokesperson for the U.S. Forest Service, told USA TODAY something similar via email, saying the claim isn't true, and the severity of the catastrophic event shouldn't be downplayed by \"baseless rumors and conspiracy theories.\"\n**Fact check:** \nFootage and photos of the wildfires spreading across Maui have been published by numerous news outlets, including ,  and .\n...[Content truncated]",

The original image - of the Waiola Church in Lahaina in flames on 8 August - has no laser beam or ray of light visible.\nTwo other false images have been racking up huge numbers of views.\nOne shows a fireball and a bright streak of light rising up towards the night sky. It, too, has been accompanied by claims that wildfires are not a natural phenomenon. \nBut a search on the internet for previous versions of this image reveals the photo shows a controlled burn at an Ohio oil refinery and was first posted online in January 2018.

Indeed, I am being careful to **avoid** drawing any conclusions until I\u2019ve conducted a methodical investigation.\nMy purpose in researching this story is to discover the truth of the matter. If I **already knew the truth of the matter**, I would not have flown eight hours to Maui to survey the scene and to speak with eyewitnesses. I would have simply typed my report in my apartment in Dallas.\nSuspicious circumstances and actors warrant an investigation, but a full and methodical investigation must be performed **before** conclusions can be legitimately drawn.

The platform flagged the post with a warning that read, \"Image captures an event that occurred in Michigan in 2018, not a current event in Hawaii.\"\n\"The Directed Energy Weapons (DEWs) being used on Hawaii are powerful enough to set the Pacific Ocean on fire,\" far-right online personality Stew Peters said.\nDEWs involve \"high energy lasers and other high power electromagnetics\" that \"use concentrated electromagnetic energy to combat enemy forces and assets,\" according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO).\nAlthough the Defense Department has spent $1 billion annually on developing these weapons to take down missile and drone threats, an April 2023 GAO report says the department has had trouble deploying these technologies outside of labs because of a lack of transition planning.\n!

The most significantly impacted area was the historic district of Lahaina, where more than 100 lives were lost.\nThe preliminary report\n----------------------\nThe MPD\u2019s examination deals exclusively with the Maui police response.

Until that report is completed, this preliminary report will be shared with other law enforcement agencies across the nation for their input and so they can also benefit from the recommendations.\nInvestigations\n--------------\nWhile several investigations into the Maui wildfires are...[Content truncated]",
