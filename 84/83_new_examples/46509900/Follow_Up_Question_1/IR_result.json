Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images)\nIf you search Twitter for information about the fires in Hawaii that have killed at least 67 people, you’re likely to find some wild conspiracy theories. In fact, a number of different verified accounts on Twitter, now officially known as X, insist space lasers are actually creating the fires in Maui—a ridiculous conspiracy theory that first gained widespread attention after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia floated the idea on Facebook in 2018.\nTo be clear, there’s absolutely no evidence that space lasers are to blame for the fires in Maui, which have destroyed at least 1,000 buildings and caused mass evacuations. But that hasn’t stopped many so-called verified accounts on Twitter from insisting that old photos actually depict lasers being shot from space in Hawaii.\nOne popular tweet that’s been viewed over 900,000 times has tried to suggest the photo below was captured showing a laser being shot at Hawaii.\n“This photo is circulating social media. Apparently this beam was captured before the Hawaii fires. Can anyone confirm?” the tweet from a verified account reads.\nTweet falsely suggesting the photo shows a laser beam that hit Hawaii before the fires in Maui.\nIn reality, the photo is from a 2019 SpaceX launch at Vandenberg Air Force Base (now known as a Space Force Base), which is located in California.\nThe image was probably popularized as being associated with lasers because it was posted to Reddit featuring a caption saying it looked like a laser. But obviously it was no such thing. Long-exposure take-off photos for space launches often look like that.\nReddit post from 2019 pointing out that a SpaceX launch looked like a laser...[Content truncated]",

The most significantly impacted area was the historic district of Lahaina, where more than 100 lives were lost.\nThe preliminary report\n----------------------\nThe MPD’s examination deals exclusively with the Maui police response. It does not address the cause and origin of the fires or the response by fire crews. During the wildfire, the MPD supported the fire response, assisting with evacuations, communications and rescue efforts.\nThe preliminary report makes 32 recommendations to improve Maui’s police response to future natural disaster response efforts, including:\n*   Updating equipment and technology.\nFor example, 2 recommendations are to provide officers with better earpieces to use when high winds make it hard to hear police radios and to equip all patrol cars with breaching kits to remove downed trees or utility poles from roadways.\n*   Improvement of communications between emergency personnel and officers.\nFor example, stationing a high-ranking officer (lieutenant or higher) in the communications center to help relay information to police commanders and giving officers in the field more briefings during recovery efforts.\nThe final MPD report is expected to be released 6 to 12 months after this preliminary report.

            "content": "False claims about the deadly wildfires in Hawaii - including that shadowy forces orchestrated the disaster with a laser beam - have gained traction online.\nThe misleading posts come from a variety of sources and accounts, but generally imply that \"elites\" or government agencies deliberately started the fires.\nSome of the most popular theories are couched in questions about a \"narrative\" and make claims that alternative views are being \"censored\", despite collecting millions of views.\nWhile there are specific rumours circulating about Maui, they fit into a general pattern repeatedly seen after extreme weather events and natural disasters -  politically motivated activists seeking to downplay the potential impact of climate change.\nVideos and images claiming that the wildfires were not a natural disaster - and were instead caused by a \"directed energy weapon\", a \"laser beam\" or explosion - have been viewed millions of times.\nOne video viewed 10 million times claims to show a large explosion in Maui just before the fires.\nBut the video was originally a viral clip shared on TikTok in May showing a transformer explosion in Chile.\nChilean TV network Chilevisión ran a report on the viral video, confirming the explosion was the result of a blown transformer caused by strong wind.\nAn image of a church on fire in Hawaii has been viewed 9 million times, with claims it shows a laser beam striking it. \nBut it has been digitally altered. The original image - of the Waiola Church in Lahaina in flames on 8 August - has no laser beam or ray of light visible.\nTwo other false images have been racking up huge numbers of views.\nOne shows a fireball and a bright streak of light rising up towards the night sky. It, too, has been accompanied by claims that wildfires are not a natural phenomenon. \nBut a search on the internet for previous versions of this image reveals the photo shows a controlled burn at an Ohio oil refinery and was first posted online in January 2018. The streak of light, known as a \"light pillar\", is an optical illusion formed by reflections off ice crystals on a cold day...[Content truncated]"

The platform flagged the post with a warning that read, \"Image captures an event that occurred in Michigan in 2018, not a current event in Hawaii.\"\n\"The Directed Energy Weapons (DEWs) being used on Hawaii are powerful enough to set the Pacific Ocean on fire,\" far-right online personality Stew Peters said.\nDEWs involve \"high energy lasers and other high power electromagnetics\" that \"use concentrated electromagnetic energy to combat enemy forces and assets,\" according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO).\nAlthough the Defense Department has spent $1 billion annually on developing these weapons to take down missile and drone threats, an April 2023 GAO report says the department has had trouble deploying these technologies outside of labs because of a lack of transition planning.\n!

        "Question": "What credible sources confirm the absence of directed energy weapons during the Maui events in August 2023?",
        "Answer": "The absence of directed energy weapons (DEWs) during the Maui events in August 2023 has been confirmed by several credible sources. Here are key points from those sources:\n\n1. **PolitiFact Confirmation**: The website PolitiFact reported that social media claims suggesting DEWs were responsible for the Maui wildfires lack credible evidence. Investigators are still determining the causes of the fires, but no credible sources have attributed them to DEWs. The report emphasizes that DEWs may exist but have not been implicated in the ignition of the wildfires that occurred on August 8, 2023. This highlights the misidentification and misinformation prevalent on social media during such disasters.\n\n2. **BBC Coverage**: In an article by the BBC, the spread of false claims regarding DEWs and their supposed role in the wildfires is discussed extensively. Specifically, they note that videos and images claiming the wildfires were not natural disasters, but rather orchestrated by DEWs, have gained traction online. The BBC clarifies that such narratives are part of broader misinformation patterns that emerge following natural disasters and that none of the claims referencing DEWs have been validated with credible evidence.\n\n3. **Newsweek Analysis**: A report by Newsweek also addressed the conspiracy theories surrounding DEWs in relation to the Hawaii wildfires. The article highlighted that while DEWs are a topic of military technology, there is no substantial evidence linking them to the fires in Maui. It pointed out that many of the images circulated as 'evidence' of DEW involvement were misidentified and not related to the current events in Hawaii.\n\nOverall, these credible sources collectively reinforce the conclusion that there is no evidence supporting the claim that directed energy weapons were responsible for the wildfires in Maui in August 2023.",
