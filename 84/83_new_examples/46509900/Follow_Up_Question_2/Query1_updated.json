The original image - of the Waiola Church in Lahaina in flames on 8 August - has no laser beam or ray of light visible.\nTwo other false images have been racking up huge numbers of views.\nOne shows a fireball and a bright streak of light rising up towards the night sky. It, too, has been accompanied by claims that wildfires are not a natural phenomenon. \nBut a search on the internet for previous versions of this image reveals the photo shows a controlled burn at an Ohio oil refinery and was first posted online in January 2018. The streak of light, known as a \"light pillar\", is an optical illusion formed by reflections off ice crystals on a cold day.\nA similar image claims to show a huge beam of light in Maui just before the wildfires. But it shows the launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in California in May 2018.\nThere are claims circulating about videos from Maui showing some trees still standing while houses and vehicles have been burned, with people pointing to the pictures as \"evidence\" that the fires were deliberately set or that their real cause is being hidden from the public.\nOne post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, includes a video of the destruction and the message: \"Everything is burnt but the trees, but don't point that out or you're a conspiracy theorist.\" \nThat post - which has been seen more than ...[Content truncated]",

These technologies are all at different levels of maturity, therefore talking about DEWs as a whole omits important nuances between the different types. There are three main systems which come under this umbrella term:\n*   **Laser-based systems:** Different types of lasers exist, of which chemical, solid-state and free-electron lasers\u00a0are most relevant. Despite being invented in the 1960s, the main obstacle to laser weapons has been the power required. Out of the different laser types, chemical lasers are the most mature. However, chemical lasers suffer from a number of impracticalities, including the fact they use hazardous substances. Free-electron lasers are a more recent discovery and therefore the least developed for weapon use. The laser weapons beginning to be deployed are solid-state (fibre) lasers.\n*   **Radio frequency systems:** This category includes high-powered microwaves as well as millimetre waves. These types of systems are more technologically mature than laser-based systems and are already in operational use.\n*   **Particle beam systems:** Particle beam systems are the least mature of the three types of DEW; these systems, unlike the others, fire atomic and sub-atomic particles. Particle beam systems would emit either charged or neutral particles. Neutral particle beam systems hold particular interest given these could be used outside of the atmosphere.\n### What effect can directed energy weapons achieve?\nThese systems are used in different circumstances and therefore lead to different effects, which can be either lethal or non-lethal.\nLasers, in particular high-power ones and particle beam systems, can lead to the disruption and destruction of equipment, whereas low-power lasers can mainly dazzle systems, such as sensors, including those on satellites. High-powered microwaves can degrade and damage electronics, and as such can be used to counter threats from uncrewed aerial systems. But they could also be used to disrupt a wide range of electronics, from smartphones and motors to command posts. Finally, millimetre waves can be used as an anti-personnel area denial weapon; while not lethal, this system can produce a burning sensation on the skin.\nWhile low-powered lasers and radio frequency-based systems are much more frequently used in the field, high-powered lasers are beginning to reach the technological maturity required to be used operationally, whereas particle-beam weapons remain far from that point.\nDEWs are of increasing concern given their low operational cost per...[Content truncated]",

More recently, they have also featured prominently in some conspiracy theories. Both types of fiction highlight the need to understand how laser weapons actually work and what they are used for.\nA laser uses electricity to generate photons, or light particles. The photons pass through a gain medium, a material that creates a cascade of additional photons, which rapidly increases the number of photons. All these photons are then focused into a narrow beam by a beam director.\nIn the decades since the first laser was unveiled in 1960, engineers have developed a variety of lasers that generate photons at different wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum, from infrared to ultraviolet. The high-energy laser systems that are finding military applications are based on solid-state lasers that use special crystals to convert the input electrical energy into photons. A key aspect of high-power solid-state lasers is that the photons are created in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and so cannot be seen by the human eye.\nWhen it interacts with a surface, a laser beam generates different effects based on its photon wavelength, the power in the beam and the material of the surface. Low-power lasers that generate photons in the visible part of the spectrum are useful as light sources for pointers and light shows at public events. These beams are of such low power that they simply reflect off a surface without damaging it. \nHigher-power laser systems are used to cut through biological tissue in medical procedures. The highest-power lasers can heat, vaporize, melt and burn through many different materials and are used in industrial processes for welding and cutting. \nIn addition to the power level of the laser, the ability to deliver these various effects is determined by the distance between the laser and its target.\nBased in part on the progress made in high-power industrial lasers, militaries are finding an increasing number of uses for high-energy lasers. One key advantage for high-energy laser weapons is that they provide an \u201cinfinite magazine.\u201d Unlike traditional weapons such as guns and cannons that have a finite amount of ammunition, a high-energy laser can keep firing as long as it has electrical power.\nThe U.S. Army is deploying a truck-based high-energy laser to shoot down a range of targets, including drones, helicopters, mortar shells and rockets. The 50-kilowatt laser is mounted on the Stryker infantry fighting vehicle, and the Army deployed four of the systems for battlefield testing in the Middle East in February 2024.\nThe U.S. Navy has deployed a ship-based...[Content truncated]",

However, GAO found that, even as DOD makes progress developing \nthese capabilities, its efforts to transition prototypes to acquisition programs face \nchallenges. \nDOD and the military departments have efforts underway to develop directed \nenergy weapons. For example, DOD and military departments developed \nmultiple laser weapon system demonstrators and prototypes, wh ich have been \nused in live fire demonstrations to successfully shoot down drones. DOD and the \nmilitary departments are also developing higher -powered laser weapons to \ncounter bigger threats. Additionally, the departments developed a range of high \npower mic rowave capabilities for purposes such as engaging missile or drone \nswarm attacks against a military base. \nNotional Depiction of High Power Microwave and High Energy Laser Defending an Installation \nHowever, DOD has long noted a gap \u2014sometimes called \u201cthe valley of death\u201d \u2014\nbetween its development and its acquisition communities that impede technology \ntransition . For example, the acquisition community may require a higher level of \ntechnology maturity than the development community is able to produce. \nFor pro totypes that a military department expects to eventually transition to a \nnew or existing acquisition program, it needs to identify a transition partner that \ncan support the further development of the new technology. To support \ntransition, the Army develope d a detailed plan describing schedules and \nstakeholder roles to build supporting activities around the use of directed energy \nweapons and early capabilities documents.
