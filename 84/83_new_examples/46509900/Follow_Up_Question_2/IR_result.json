More recently, they have also featured prominently in some conspiracy theories. Both types of fiction highlight the need to understand how laser weapons actually work and what they are used for.\nA laser uses electricity to generate photons, or light particles. The photons pass through a gain medium, a material that creates a cascade of additional photons, which rapidly increases the number of photons. All these photons are then focused into a narrow beam by a beam director.\nIn the decades since the first laser was unveiled in 1960, engineers have developed a variety of lasers that generate photons at different wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum, from infrared to ultraviolet. The high-energy laser systems that are finding military applications are based on solid-state lasers that use special crystals to convert the input electrical energy into photons. A key aspect of high-power solid-state lasers is that the photons are created in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and so cannot be seen by the human eye.\nWhen it interacts with a surface, a laser beam generates different effects based on its photon wavelength, the power in the beam and the material of the surface. Low-power lasers that generate photons in the visible part of the spectrum are useful as light sources for pointers and light shows at public events. These beams are of such low power that they simply reflect off a surface without damaging it. \nHigher-power laser systems are used to cut through biological tissue in medical procedures. The highest-power lasers can heat, vaporize, melt and burn through many different materials and are used in industrial processes for welding and cutting. \nIn addition to the power level of the laser, the ability to deliver these various effects is determined by the distance between the laser and its target.\nBased in part on the progress made in high-power industrial lasers, militaries are finding an increasing number of uses for high-energy lasers. One key advantage for high-energy laser weapons is that they provide an “infinite magazine.” Unlike traditional weapons such as guns and cannons that have a finite amount of ammunition, a high-energy laser can keep firing as long as it has electrical power.\nThe U.S. Army is deploying a truck-based high-energy laser to shoot down a range of targets, including drones, helicopters, mortar shells and rockets. The 50-kilowatt laser is mounted on the Stryker infantry fighting vehicle, and the Army deployed four of the systems for battlefield testing in the Middle East in February 2024.\nThe U.S. Navy has deployed a ship-based...[Content truncated]",

These weapons use electromagnetic energy to cause effects ranging from deterrence to destruction. They offer capabilities that conventional weapons may not, but challenges have so far prevented widespread operational use.\nThe Technology\n--------------\n**What is it?** Directed energy weapons (DEW) use concentrated electromagnetic energy to combat enemy forces and assets. These weapons include high energy lasers and other high power electromagnetics—such as millimeter wave and high power microwave weapons. Unlike weapons that fire bullets or missiles, DEWs can respond to a threat in different ways. For example, they can temporarily degrade electronics on a drone or physically destroy it. See our 2022  for more information on counter-drone technology.\n**How does it work?** Each type of DEW uses a different region of the electromagnetic spectrum (see fig. 1). This spectrum describes all of the kinds of light—including those the human eye cannot see—and classifies them according to wavelength. Different types of electromagnetic energy have different properties. For example, the wavelength affects what the directed energy can penetrate—such as metal or human skin.\n!\nFigure 1.

Are these weapons still science fiction, lab experiments, or are they real? How can they be used and how disruptive can they be? What are the challenges and next steps? This article will examine answers to these questions.\nAccording to DOD’s Joint Publication 3–13 Electronic Warfare, directed energy (DE) is described as an:\numbrella term covering technologies that produce a beam of concentrated electromagnetic energy or atomic or subatomic particles. A DE weapon is a system using DE primarily as a direct means to disable, damage or destroy adversary equipment, facilities, and personnel. DE warfare is military action involving the use of DE weapons, devices, and countermeasures to either cause direct damage or destruction of adversary equipment, facilities, and personnel, or to determine, exploit, reduce, or prevent hostile use of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) through damage, destruction, and disruption.1\nDE weapons include high-energy lasers, high-power radio frequency or microwave devices, and charged or neutral particle beam weapons.2 Microwaves and lasers are both part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which includes light energy and radio waves. The distinction between them is the wavelength/frequency of the energy. While they are both part of the electromagnetic spectrum, laser and microwave weapons operate very differently and have very different effects.\nThink of the difference between a laser pointer and a flashlight. The laser light is coherent in a single color, and the flashlight is broad-spectrum light. Because of its coherence, laser light can stay concentrated for very long distances—even thousands of miles into space. But with laser weapons, instead of thinking in terms of a laser pointer, the mental image should be more like a powerful, long-range blowtorch!\nLasers can be categorized as gas, solid state, or a hybrid of the two. The lasers on the current path to weaponization include solid state combined fiber and crystal slab as well as hybrid lasers. Fiber lasers are lasers in which the active medium being used is an optical fiber that has been doped in rare elements, most often Erbium.3 Slab lasers represent one class of high-power solid-state lasers in which the laser crystal has the form of a slab.4 Hybrid lasers such as a diode pumped alkali laser use a combination of trace gas with semiconductor diode arrays for even higher power and efficiency.5\nThe destructive power of directed energy weapons (their lethality) derives from the amount of energy transferred to the target over time.

The original image - of the Waiola Church in Lahaina in flames on 8 August - has no laser beam or ray of light visible.\nTwo other false images have been racking up huge numbers of views.\nOne shows a fireball and a bright streak of light rising up towards the night sky. It, too, has been accompanied by claims that wildfires are not a natural phenomenon. \nBut a search on the internet for previous versions of this image reveals the photo shows a controlled burn at an Ohio oil refinery and was first posted online in January 2018. The streak of light, known as a \"light pillar\", is an optical illusion formed by reflections off ice crystals on a cold day.\nA similar image claims to show a huge beam of light in Maui just before the wildfires. But it shows the launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in California in May 2018.\nThere are claims circulating about videos from Maui showing some trees still standing while houses and vehicles have been burned, with people pointing to the pictures as \"evidence\" that the fires were deliberately set or that their real cause is being hidden from the public.\nOne post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, includes a video of the destruction and the message: \"Everything is burnt but the trees, but don't point that out or you're a conspiracy theorist.\" \nThat post - which has been seen more than 24 million times - has been challenged by X's Community Notes feature, where users add context and facts around viral content. \nDr Rory Hadden, senior lecturer and expert in fire investigations at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Verify that it is common for trees to remain standing even after severe wildfires because \"burning through a large piece of wood takes a long time\", \"thick pieces of wood are usually not able to sustain burning on their own\" and \"the high moisture content of trees will also make them hard to burn\".\nSome plants, known as pyrophytes, have also adapted to survive wildfires due to thermal insulation or other means.\nAlongside the \"directed energy weapon\" rumours, speculation spread in viral posts that some of the island's rich inhabitants and second-home owners deliberately started the wildfires to grab valuable land in Lahaina.\nOne viral video includes claims by a podcaster that native landowners...[Content truncated]"

More recently, they have also featured prominently in some conspiracy theories. Both types of fiction highlight the need to understand how laser weapons actually work and what they are used for.\nA laser uses electricity to generate photons, or light particles. The photons pass through a gain medium, a material that creates a cascade of additional photons, which rapidly increases the number of photons. All these photons are then focused into a narrow beam by a beam director.\nIn the decades since the first laser was unveiled in 1960, engineers have developed a variety of lasers that generate photons at different wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum, from infrared to ultraviolet. The high-energy laser systems that are finding military applications are based on solid-state lasers that use special crystals to convert the input electrical energy into photons. A key aspect of high-power solid-state lasers is that the photons are created in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and so cannot be seen by the human eye.\nWhen it interacts with a surface, a laser beam generates different effects based on its photon wavelength, the power in the beam and the material of the surface. Low-power lasers that generate photons in the visible part of the spectrum are useful as light sources for pointers and light shows at public events. These beams are of such low power that they simply reflect off a surface without damaging it. \nHigher-power laser systems are used to cut through biological tissue in medical procedures. The highest-power lasers can heat, vaporize, melt and burn through many different materials and are used in industrial processes for welding and cutting. \nIn addition to the power level of the laser, the ability to deliver these various effects is determined by the distance between the laser and its target.\nBased in part on the progress made in high-power industrial lasers, militaries are finding an increasing number of uses for high-energy lasers. One key advantage for high-energy laser weapons is that they provide an “infinite magazine.” Unlike traditional weapons such as guns and cannons that have a finite amount of ammunition, a high-energy laser can keep firing as long as it has electrical power.\nThe U.S. Army is deploying a truck-based high-energy laser to shoot down a range of targets, including drones, helicopters, mortar shells and rockets. The 50-kilowatt laser is mounted on the Stryker infantry fighting vehicle, and the Army deployed four of the systems for battlefield testing in the Middle East in February 2024.\nThe U.S. Navy has deployed a ship-based...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What do experts say about the effects and visibility of directed energy weapons in real-world fire incidents?",
        "Answer": "Experts generally indicate that directed energy weapons (DEWs), while conceptually intriguing and a subject of military development, would not behave as popularly depicted in videos and conspiracy theories about real-world fire incidents. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Invisibility of Higher Power Lasers**: Most high-energy laser systems used in military applications operate primarily in the infrared spectrum, which means they are not visible to the human eye. Thus, if such a weapon were present at an incident like the Maui wildfires, its operational characteristics would not align with visible light phenomena, such as those seen in fireworks.\n\n2. **Debunking Misattributed Effects**: Claims that link DEWs to specific fire incidents often rely on misinterpretation or misattribution of video evidence. For instance, numerous viral videos and images, which allegedly show DEW activity or explosions, have been debunked as either unrelated footage or digitally altered. This illustrates that many of the visuals circulating online do not provide credible evidence of DEW involvement since they have been proven to stem from different contexts or events.\n\n3. **Common Misconceptions about Fire Behavior**: Some narratives suggest that certain trees survived wildfires while nearby structures burned, positing this as evidence of directed energy weapons. However, experts clarify that it's not uncommon for thick trees to remain standing due to their considerable moisture content and the time it takes for large wood pieces to ignite and sustain burning. This natural phenomenon is often misconstrued in the context of DEW theories, further demonstrating the lack of understanding about fire dynamics.\n\n4. **Clarification on DEW Utilization**: While DEWs in military contexts indeed exist and can be effective against specific targets, their application in civilian fire incidents hasn’t been substantiated by credible evidence related to such events as the Maui wildfires. Experts clarify that laser weapons serve particular military purposes that do not extend to starting wildfires in urban or civilian settings.\n\nOverall, while DEWs are a part of modern military technology, their visibility and effects in real-world scenarios are often misrepresented, particularly in connection to urban fire incidents.",
