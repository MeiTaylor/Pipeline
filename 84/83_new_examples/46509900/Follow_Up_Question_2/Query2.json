These weapons use electromagnetic energy to cause effects ranging from deterrence to destruction. They offer capabilities that conventional weapons may not, but challenges have so far prevented widespread operational use.\nThe Technology\n--------------\n**What is it?** Directed energy weapons (DEW) use concentrated electromagnetic energy to combat enemy forces and assets. These weapons include high energy lasers and other high power electromagnetics—such as millimeter wave and high power microwave weapons. Unlike weapons that fire bullets or missiles, DEWs can respond to a threat in different ways. For example, they can temporarily degrade electronics on a drone or physically destroy it. See our 2022  for more information on counter-drone technology.\n**How does it work?** Each type of DEW uses a different region of the electromagnetic spectrum (see fig. 1). This spectrum describes all of the kinds of light—including those the human eye cannot see—and classifies them according to wavelength. Different types of electromagnetic energy have different properties. For example, the wavelength affects what the directed energy can penetrate—such as metal or human skin.\n!\nFigure 1. Location of directed energy weapons on the electromagnetic spectrum.\nAll DEWs emit energy at the speed of light, and are often discussed in terms of their power output—the amount of electromagnetic energy transferred over time...[Content truncated]",

Are these weapons still science fiction, lab experiments, or are they real? How can they be used and how disruptive can they be? What are the challenges and next steps? This article will examine answers to these questions.\nAccording to DOD’s Joint Publication 3–13 Electronic Warfare, directed energy (DE) is described as an:\numbrella term covering technologies that produce a beam of concentrated electromagnetic energy or atomic or subatomic particles. A DE weapon is a system using DE primarily as a direct means to disable, damage or destroy adversary equipment, facilities, and personnel. DE warfare is military action involving the use of DE weapons, devices, and countermeasures to either cause direct damage or destruction of adversary equipment, facilities, and personnel, or to determine, exploit, reduce, or prevent hostile use of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) through damage, destruction, and disruption.1\nDE weapons include high-energy lasers, high-power radio frequency or microwave devices, and charged or neutral particle beam weapons.2 Microwaves and lasers are both part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which includes light energy and radio waves. The distinction between them is the wavelength/frequency of the energy. While they are both part of the electromagnetic spectrum, laser and microwave weapons operate very differently and have very different effects.\nThink of the difference between a laser pointer and a flashlight. The laser light is coherent in a single color, and the flashlight is broad-spectrum light. Because of its coherence, laser light can stay concentrated for very long distances—even thousands of miles into space. But with laser weapons, instead of thinking in terms of a laser pointer, the mental image should be more like a powerful, long-range blowtorch!\nLasers can be categorized as gas, solid state, or a hybrid of the two. The lasers on the current path to weaponization include solid state combined fiber and crystal slab as well as hybrid lasers. Fiber lasers are lasers in which the active medium being used is an optical fiber that has been doped in rare elements, most often Erbium.3 Slab lasers represent one class of high-power solid-state lasers in which the laser crystal has the form of a slab.4 Hybrid lasers such as a diode pumped alkali laser use a combination of trace gas with semiconductor diode arrays for even higher power and efficiency.5\nThe destructive power of directed energy weapons (their lethality) derives from the amount of energy transferred to the target over time.

The enemy's sensors try to get a fix, as the planet surface races past below. In an instant, a beam reaches out from below at the speed of light, the high-powered laser burning through its target. This is not Star Wars: This is Scotland, last week, where the UK Ministry of Defence and its industry partners conducted the first successful firing of their DragonFire laser weapon against an aerial target.\nWith this trial, the culmination of £100 million of investment to date, the United Kingdom joined other nations racing to develop and deploy what are known in military parlance as directed energy weapons (DEW). Though the technology is yet to mature, the United States has begun to deploy early laser weapons on several of its naval destroyers, as well as testing ground- and air-based versions.\nFollowing the October 7 attacks by Hamas, Israel has sought to expedite development of its own Iron Beam laser weapon to help shoot down incoming rockets and drones, augmenting the kinetic interceptors of its Iron Dome missile defence system.

The original image - of the Waiola Church in Lahaina in flames on 8 August - has no laser beam or ray of light visible.\nTwo other false images have been racking up huge numbers of views.\nOne shows a fireball and a bright streak of light rising up towards the night sky. It, too, has been accompanied by claims that wildfires are not a natural phenomenon. \nBut a search on the internet for previous versions of this image reveals the photo shows a controlled burn at an Ohio oil refinery and was first posted online in January 2018. The streak of light, known as a \"light pillar\", is an optical illusion formed by reflections off ice crystals on a cold day.\nA similar image claims to show a huge beam of light in Maui just before the wildfires. But it shows the launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in California in May 2018.\nThere are claims circulating about videos from Maui showing some trees still standing while houses and vehicles have been burned, with people pointing to the pictures as \"evidence\" that the fires were deliberately set or that their real cause is being hidden from the public.\nOne post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, includes a video of the destruction and the message: \"Everything is burnt but the trees, but don't point that out or you're a conspiracy theorist.\" \nThat post - which has been seen more than 24 million times - has been challenged by X's Community Notes feature, where users add context and facts around viral content. \nDr Rory Hadden, senior lecturer and expert in fire investigations at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Verify that it is common for trees to remain standing even after severe wildfires because \"burning through a large piece of wood takes a long time\", \"thick pieces of wood are usually not able to sustain burning on their own\" and \"the high moisture content of trees will also make them hard to burn\".\nSome plants, known as pyrophytes, have also adapted to survive wildfires due to thermal insulation or other means.\nAlongside the \"directed energy weapon\" rumours, speculation spread in viral posts that some of the island's rich inhabitants and second-home owners deliberately started the wildfires to grab valuable land in Lahaina.\nOne viral video includes claims by a podcaster that native landowners...[Content truncated]",

In the late '70s and '80s there was a trend to attach a little beeper to systems like that fro an audible feedback of them getting ready to use. That is the high pitched noise getting somewhat higher until it reaches a certain frequency. That is a sound an energy weapon could generate. $\\\\endgroup$\n    – \n    Commented Jan 12, 2016 at 12:05\n |  \n5 Answers 5\n-----------\nSorted by: \nHighest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first)\n67\n$\\\\begingroup$\nIn space, no-one (else) can really _hear_ your weapon fire, unless their ship's sensors can detect the weapon firing (by its electromagnetic signature) and provide an artificial audible feedback. This could be anything from \"Pew\" or \"Zap\" or \"crack\" to \"Energy weapons fire detected bearing...\".\nIn an atmosphere, the audible signature of the weapon depends on the power of the weapon. Where the power of an energy weapon is high enough to ionise the air it passes through, the cessation of the beam results in the low-pressure ionised path it carved in the atmosphere collapsing with a crack or a bang, the loudness increasing and the pitch decreasing with the diameter of the ionised path.  in an atmosphere typically make a distinctive crack or bang with each pulse.\nThe weapon itself may be entirely silent, or it may make a quiet, high-pitched whine similar to the charging capacitors in a camera flash. Indeed, many solid rod lasers are pumped using flash tubes, so this high-energy capacitor whine would be entirely in-character.\nIt is possible that a weapon might whine quietly, the pitch increasing as charge accumulates, holding at a high pitch when full charge is reached and maintained, followed by a crack as the weapon is fired and a quiet, low, rising tone as the weapon charges again.\nFollow \nanswered Jan 12, 2016 at 2:25\n]\n♦Monty Wild\n63.5k1212 gold badges141141 silver badges318318 bronze badges\n$\\\\endgroup$\n5\n*   1\n    $\\\\begingroup$ What about plasma weapons, my instinctive answers was.
