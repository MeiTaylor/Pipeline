The price tags are stickers that can easily be peeled off then stuck to something else. Could one theoretically grab a tag off of one of the other models that's like $18 and put it on the $80 one and get away with it? The models are robots from an anime that all have names like SY-89-3 (😉), so even if the serial number on the tag they punch in brings up the product name on the computer I doubt they'd notice.
