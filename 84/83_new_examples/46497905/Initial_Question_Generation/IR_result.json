            "content": "]\nJoe Woodland  -- that collection of lines and numbers used to ring up your groceries every time you visit the supermarket -- and after the longtime IBMer passed away earlier this month at the age of 91, the response from certain parts of the web was all too predictable.\n\"It's the mark of the beast!\"  in response to our Joe Woodland tribute, pointing readers to the . Revelation is the final book of the Bible's New Testament, and among other things, it foretells an apocalypse in which a beast will rise from the earth, rain fire from the heavens, and lay his mark on all of humankind -- a mark used to buy and sell.\n\"He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name,\" reads the 13th chapter. \"Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666.\"\nPresumably, that commenter was having a bit of fun -- he calls himself \"Full Metal Pizza\" and his tagline is \"Soylent Green is STILL made out of people!!!\" -- but ever since Woodland and his IBM colleagues introduced the Universal Product Code, they've been chased by claims that it's a step toward the apocalypse -- and not all these claims...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "Is there any official statement from Hobby Lobby about not using barcodes due to the mark of the beast?",
        "Answer": "Hobby Lobby does not officially state that they do not use barcodes because they believe barcodes are the \"mark of the beast.\" Instead, the reason for their policy appears to be linked to a preference for human interaction in the store's operations. David Green, the founder and CEO of Hobby Lobby, has expressed in his book, \"More Than a Hobby,\" that opting against barcodes and scanners emphasizes putting people first and ensuring that employees do not feel that the company prioritizes computers over them. Additionally, Green argues that manual inventory processes allow employees to have a better understanding of the store's inventory compared to relying solely on computer systems.\n\nWhile the idea that barcodes could be considered a \"mark of the beast\" has circulated since the 1970s, this notion is generally regarded as speculation, and former employees have dispelled the idea that it significantly influences Hobby Lobby's decision.\n\nBased on the analysis of the evidence, I would evaluate the confidence in the accuracy of this answer at around 85%. This is due to the strong references from Hobby Lobby's founder regarding operational philosophy, albeit the discussions around barcodes and their biblical connotations are widely acknowledged but not officially supported by Hobby Lobby as a reason for their practices.",
