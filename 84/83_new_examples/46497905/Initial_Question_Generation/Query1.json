So  \nhe's got humble beginnings, you could say. Um. Now, David  \ngrew up in Altus, which is about five hours away\n(05:32):  \nfrom the tiny town in Oklahoma where I grew up.  \nIt was as close to the middle of nowhere as  \nyou can get.

Instead, he started working in the business  \nworld as soon as he could. During his junior year  \nof high school, David got involved in a work study  \nprogram and landed a gig as a stock boy in  \nthe town general store. He only made sixty cents an hour,  \nbut he became aware of the basics of how capitalism\n(06:35):  \nworks watching his boss by products for ten cents and  \nsell them for twenty.

For a package with steps for a dollhouse, one package is priced at $14.99, while the one directly behind it is $8.49.\nIn  from Jan. 13, TikToker @mamaericaaaa shows decorative pig figurines, one of which is $14.99 and another that is $7.99. Other videos show , including one from @thebowhuntress, where one decorative sign is $39.99 and the same one behind it is $49.99.\n\"Check those prices before you buy the most expensive one,\" @thebowhuntress cautions in the Dec. 2023 TikTok.\nBut is this something that happens at every Hobby Lobby location? The videos suggest it may be a larger issue—and according to former employees, pricing differences are normal.\nIn the comment section of @brandy.english's video, a former Hobby Lobby employee explained, \"Because there's no bar codes, the only way to raise the prices on products is for the new ones to be priced higher—hence the price discrepancies on new stock.\"\nAnother added, \"If they change the prices of an item, we don't take the old ones off the shelves.\" And yes, whatever the sticker says is what associates will manually type in at the register, regardless of any price discrepancies that appear between items on shelves.\n**RELATED: **\nInstead of scanning an SKU or a product code, Hobby Lobby cashiers type in prices themselves. Beyond complaints that it ends up with shoppers , rumors have also circulated that the company's Christian founders believe barcodes are the mark of the beast. However, Snopes  in July 2023, noting that there was no evidence to support the claim.\nWhen looking at Hobby Lobby's , the company doesn't include information on why there would be different prices for the same items within stores. (It does clarify that prices, products, and promotions at brick-and-mortar stores might differ from those online.)\nIn terms of price matching, the company notes that it will honor competitors' ads in-store if they meet certain criteria, but within Hobby Lobby stores, the price matching policy is a bit of a gray area. In a Jan. 13 , @thebowhuntress took it upon herself to see if Hobby Lobby associates would change prices for her when purchasing two of the same item.\n>             ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb\n> \n> \n\"Today I am going to go in the Hobby Lobby and see if I can get a legitimate...[Content truncated]",

Since its founding in 1972, Hobby Lobby has maintained a policy of keeping its stores shut every Sunday, bucking the retail trend of staying open seven days a week. So why does this multi-billion dollar company choose to sacrifice a day‘s worth of sales each week? The answer lies in the religious beliefs of Hobby Lobby‘s founder and CEO, David Green.\nThe Power of Faith-Driven Leadership\n------------------------------------\nGreen, who started Hobby Lobby as a small home business with his wife Barbara, is an evangelical Christian. His faith has always played a central role in how he runs the company. \"We believe that it is by God‘s grace and provision that Hobby Lobby has endured,\" Green wrote in a  posted on the Hobby Lobby website. \"He has been faithful in the past, we trust Him for our future, and we give Him the glory for the achievements of the company.\"\nFor Green, closing on Sundays is a way to honor God and follow the Biblical commandment to keep the Sabbath holy. He views it as a matter of principle, even though he acknowledges that the policy has financial drawbacks for Hobby Lobby. \"We‘re probably open about 66 hours a week, not 72 hours, which is a 15% cut in just being open,\" Green told  magazine. \"We give up a lot by being closed on Sunday but we‘ve been blessed in spite of...[Content truncated]",
