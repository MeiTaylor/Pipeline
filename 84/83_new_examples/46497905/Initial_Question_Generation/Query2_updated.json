Revelation is the final book of the Bible's New Testament, and among other things, it foretells an apocalypse in which a beast will rise from the earth, rain fire from the heavens, and lay his mark on all of humankind -- a mark used to buy and sell.\n\"He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name,\" reads the 13th chapter. \"Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666.\"\nPresumably, that commenter was having a bit of fun -- he calls himself \"Full Metal Pizza\" and his tagline is \"Soylent Green is STILL made out of people!!!\" -- but ever since Woodland and his IBM colleagues introduced the Universal Product Code, they've been chased by claims that it's a step toward the apocalypse -- and not all these claims...[Content truncated]",

My laser is the large Neje 3 Max with the A40640 laser head. I clean up the plans with Inkscape and burn with Lightburn software. The lightburn auto detects the different colors and sets up a different cut for each color. For a full cut I go 3 passes, 100% power, at 6000mm/min speed. For a score cut I go 2 passes at 70% power, same speed. For a shallow score (like a blue line on a wing) I go 1 pass at 50% power, same speed. If I just want to cut the paper (like for peeling it) I go 1 pass at 25% power, same speed. Finally, if I just want to leave a reference mark on the paper without cutting it I go 1 pass at 15% power, same speed. By keeping the speed real high, it prevents the laser from lingering and reduces melting. It only takes a couple minutes for a full sheet. All cuts are with air assist.  \nCost: the hobby lobby foam is $2.99 per sheet but it is worth the cost for the convenience.  \nWeight: it is a little heavier. I weighed 5 sheets each of Hobby Lobby black, Dollar Tree black with white core, and regular DTFB. The DT black weighed 103.4 grams. The regular DTFB weighed 112 grams. The Hobby Lobby black weighed 158.2 grams. I made up some of the weight by adding holes to internal...[Content truncated]",

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.\n(NEXSTAR) \u2013 There is hardly any item you can purchase that doesn\u2019t have a barcode. In fact, getting to the checkout only to learn your item doesn\u2019t have a barcode can prove to be a challenge.\nUnless you\u2019re shopping at a certain national retailer \u2013 then a barcode may actually be a problem.\nFrequent visitors to Hobby Lobby may have noticed that their cashiers don\u2019t scan tags but rather manually enter the item\u2019s price and, if applicable, sale prices.\nWhy?\nSome have speculated that Hobby Lobby, well-known for  by Evangelical Christians, fears barcodes are the \u201cmark of the beast,\u201d which is mentioned in the final book of the Bible. There, in , a beast is described. That apocalyptic beast would put its mark on all people, and that things could not be bought or sold \u201cunless they had the mark.\u201d\nThe idea that the barcode is a \u201cmark of the beast\u201d stretches back to the 1970s, according to . George Laurer, creator of the modern UPC, reportedly called the idea that it has any connection to the Bible, \u201cludicrous.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hard to say that that lore has any impact on Hobby Lobby\u2019s decision to not use barcodes. Former employees have debunked the claim, including TikTok user , who said the company\u2019s owner simply believes in the power of humans over computers.\nHobby Lobby founder and CEO David Green wrote in his book, \u201cMore Than a Hobby,\u201d that opting against barcodes and scanners at registers puts people first. He writes that he doesn\u2019t want employees to think the company values computers over them, according to a .\nGreen also explained in his 2010 book that he believes employees will have a better understanding of what is in the store if they take inventory manually rather than trusting a computer to tell them what is and isn\u2019t in stock.\nMore\n----\nOklahoma News\n-------------\n### \n### \n### \nThough some have  as slow...[Content truncated]",
