Products that are its own brand have their price printed on the packaging. But for products that come from other vendors, Hobby Lobby puts a sticker with the price on it, Seth says.\nHe claims that Hobby Lobby workers have to remember all the sales from each week so they can input them into the company\u2019s system, which seems ineffective or at least difficult compared to a barcode system.\n\u201cFr literally so hard to check people out at that store,\u201d Seth added in his video\u2019s caption.\nSeveral viewers agreed with how difficult it is to check out at Hobby Lobby.\n\u201cYes checking out at hobby lobby is the worst! So inefficient,\u201d one viewer commented on the video.\n\u201cMy mom works at hobby lobby as her retirement job\u2026 she is also confused,\u201d another viewer commented. In response, Seth wrote, \u201cIf hobby lobby wasn\u2019t \u2026 hobby lobby\u2026 it\u2019d be an awesome retirement job lol.\u201d\nWhile some users agreed that the system seemed unconventional, they applauded the theory itself.\n\u201cThis sounds absolutely insane but i do respect that the CEO prefers humans to computers,\u201d one user said.\nSome viewers said the refusal to use barcodes surely leads to problems for cashiers and customers alike.\n\u201cI hate going in there because I feel like everything is on sale and they never give me the sale price lol,\u201d one user said.\n\u201cI wonder how often customers are getting overcharged by a cashier who forgets a sale,\u201d a second user wrote.\nA third commented, \u201cno wonder it takes awhile at checkout.\u201d\nIn response to that comment, the Seth...[Content truncated]",

The decision partially stems from Hobby Lobby\u2019s core value of emphasizing people over profits.\u00a0 Green never wants to send a message to his employees that conveys, \u201cInstead of using you, I am going to use the computer to replenish your stores.\u201d\u00a0 In his book, More Than a Hobby, Green insists that barcodes just don\u2019t pay their way.\u00a0 Green maintains that employees know what\u2019s on shelves and can better help customers if they take inventory the old-fashioned way, by counting. \u201cThe computer won\u2019t know if products are broken or stolen\u201d, he says. \u201cIt blithely goes on telling the staff they have such-and-such, when in fact they don\u2019t.\u201d\n### Share this:\n*   \n*   \nLike Loading...\n### _Related_\nFiled under \n### 19 responses to \u201c_David Green: Bypassing the Barcode (Part\u00a02)_\u201d\n1.  !

He also mentioned how it makes the cashier\u2019s job much harder, because they have to manually type in every number when checking out items. They also have to remember ALL special sales and discounts in the store. The theory started floating around TikTok and led to user arenclelle debunking the theory. Arenclelle worked at Hobby Lobby at age 16, and explained that the owner simply believed in \u201cthe power of humans over technology.\u201d\n>  with @ambernicholeee fr literally so hard to check people out at that store\n> \n> \nThis aligns with what Green wrote in his book, , where he emphasized wanting to show his employees that they were valued more than a computer. He believed that human cashiers were more accurate than a machine (debatable), and that they would know the store and products better when not relying on barcodes.\nThe prevalence of Christian conspiracy theories\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhile the Hobby Lobby barcode theory was debunked, it did renew interest in the bizarre Mark of the Beast/barcodes conspiracy theory. The theory sprung up as early as the 1970s, when the use of barcodes started becoming more commercialized. George Laurer was credited with incorporating barcodes into the retail industry by modifying Woodland\u2019s original design into the barcodes we\u2019re familiar with today. However, he recalled  that accused him of carrying out the Beast\u2019s orders, and spent lots of time denying claims that the Beast\u2019s number, 666, was hidden in every barcode. Who knew Satan liked writing letters?\nWhile it seems laughable that people would think these codes were satanic symbols, conspiracy theories do have a tendency to rise during social unrest. Christians are  to conspiracy theories, and the Christian Right often uses this to its advantage, employing paranoia and perceived cultural threats to foster conspiracy-like thinking and hysteria to gain power. So think about that next time you\u2019re buying a pack of gum from the corner store.\n(featured image: Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n* * *\n_The Mary Sue is supported by our audience.
