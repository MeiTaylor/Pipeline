So inefficient,” one viewer commented on the video.\n“My mom works at hobby lobby as her retirement job… she is also confused,” another viewer commented.

They also have to remember ALL special sales and discounts in the store. The theory started floating around TikTok and led to user arenclelle debunking the theory.

He believed that human cashiers were more accurate than a machine (debatable), and that they would know the store and products better when not relying on barcodes.\nThe prevalence of Christian conspiracy theories\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhile the Hobby Lobby barcode theory was debunked, it did renew interest in the bizarre Mark of the Beast/barcodes conspiracy theory. The theory sprung up as early as the 1970s, when the use of barcodes started becoming more commercialized. George Laurer was credited with incorporating barcodes into the retail industry by modifying Woodland’s original design into the barcodes we’re familiar with today. However, he recalled  that accused him of carrying out the Beast’s orders, and spent lots of time denying claims that the Beast’s number, 666, was hidden in every barcode. Who knew Satan liked writing letters?\nWhile it seems laughable that people would think these codes were satanic symbols, conspiracy theories do have a tendency to rise during social unrest. Christians are  to conspiracy theories, and the Christian Right often uses this to its advantage, employing paranoia and perceived cultural threats to foster conspiracy-like thinking and hysteria to gain power. So think about that next time you’re buying a pack of gum from the corner store.\n(featured image: Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n* * *\n_The Mary Sue is supported by our audience.

And in the years that followed, an , warning gullible types that the number 666 was hidden in each bar code. George Laurer -- who designed the bar code as we know it today, expanding on Woodland's original idea -- once received a letter via registered mail from someone who claimed to be Satan and asked Laurer how it felt to have carried out his orders.\n\\>'All of this is pure bunk and is no more important than the fact that my first, middle, and last name all have 6 letters.'\n\\-George Laurer\nLaurer -- who has clearly tired of answering questions about the UPC and its supposed connection to the Book of Revelation -- calls all this \"ludicrous.\" But it's also rather amusing. Laurer has  that the three longer \"guide bars\" in each code -- one at the front, one in the middle, and one at the end -- do not represent 6's, hoping to put that urban legend to rest. But you can't squash human nature. If someone wants to find proof that the apocalypse is upon us, they will find it.\nWhen Joe Woodland dreamed up the bar code in the late 1940s, it looked like a bull's-eye -- a series of concentric circles. But although Woodland went to work for IBM in the early '50s and helped Big Blue push the UPC into the market, he sold his original bull's eye patent to another company, and the code IBM settled on looked more like a rectangle -- a series of short, parallel lines.\nThis code was designed by Laurer, and it's what you see on your groceries today. Basically, an optical scanner reads the distance between the edge of each line, and these distances correspond to numbers that can then be used to identify a product.\nMost Popular\n*   ]\n    Science\n    By Paolo Armelli\n*   ]\n    Politics\n    By Makena Kelly\n*   ]\n    Gear\n    By Parker Hall\n*   ]\n    The Big Story\n    By Sandra Upson\nLaurer first realized the code could be construed as some sort of ap...[Content truncated]",

It is possible that the technology we are seeing today represents the beginning stages of what may eventually be used as the mark of the beast. It is important to realize that a medical implant chip is not the mark of the beast. The mark of the beast will be something given only to those who worship the Antichrist. Having a medical or financial microchip inserted into your right hand or forehead is not the mark of the beast. The mark of the beast will be an end-times identification required by the Antichrist in order to buy or sell, and it will be given only to those who worship the Antichrist.\nMany good expositors of Revelation differ widely as to the exact nature of the mark of the beast. Besides the implanted chip view, other speculations include an ID card, a microchip, a barcode that is tattooed into the skin, or simply a mark that identifies someone as being faithful to the Antichrist’s kingdom. This last view requires the least speculation, since it does not add any more information to what the Bible gives us. In other words, any of these things are possible, but at the same time they are all speculations. We should not spend a lot of time speculating on the precise details.\nThe  is a mystery as well. Some speculated that there was a connection to June 6, 2006—06/06/06. However, in Revelation chapter 13, the number 666 identifies a person, not a date. Revelation 13:18 tells us, “This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is man’s number. His number is 666.” Somehow, the number 666 will identify the Antichrist. For centuries Bible interpreters have been trying to identify certain individuals with 666. Nothing is conclusive. That is why Revelation 13:18 says the number requires wisdom. When the Antichrist is revealed (2 Thessalonians 2:3-4), it will be clear who he is and how the number 666 identifies him.\n**Return to:\nWhat is the mark of the beast?\n**\n##### Subscribe to the\n### Question of the Week\nGet our Question of the Week delivered right to your inbox!",

Products that are its own brand have their price printed on the packaging. But for products that come from other vendors, Hobby Lobby puts a sticker with the price on it, Seth says.\nHe claims that Hobby Lobby workers have to remember all the sales from each week so they can input them into the company’s system, which seems ineffective or at least difficult compared to a barcode system.\n“Fr literally so hard to check people out at that store,” Seth added in his video’s caption.\nSeveral viewers agreed with how difficult it is to check out at Hobby Lobby.\n“Yes checking out at hobby lobby is the worst! So inefficient,” one viewer commented on the video.\n“My mom works at hobby lobby as her retirement job… she is also confused,” another viewer commented. In response, Seth wrote, “If hobby lobby wasn’t … hobby lobby… it’d be an awesome retirement job lol.”\nWhile some users agreed that the system seemed unconventional, they applauded the theory itself.\n“This sounds absolutely insane but i do respect that the CEO prefers humans to computers,” one user said.\nSome viewers said the refusal to use barcodes surely leads to problems for cashiers and customers alike.\n“I hate going in there because I feel like everything is on sale and they never give me the sale price lol,” one user said.\n“I wonder how often customers are getting overcharged by a cashier who forgets a sale,” a second user wrote.\nA third commented, “no wonder it takes awhile at checkout.”\nIn response to that comment, the Seth...[Content truncated]"

            "content": "[Content truncated]...> Hobby Lobby Barcode Revelation     \n> \n> \nMagni.fy went to his local Hobby Lobby and confirmed that the store doesn’t use barcodes on any of its items. He also mentioned how it makes the cashier’s job much harder, because they have to manually type in every number when checking out items. They also have to remember ALL special sales and discounts in the store. The theory started floating around TikTok and led to user arenclelle debunking the theory. Arenclelle worked at Hobby Lobby at age 16, and explained that the owner simply believed in “the power of humans over technology.”\n>  with @ambernicholeee fr literally so hard to check people out at that store\n> \n> \nThis aligns with what Green wrote in his book, , where he emphasized wanting to show his employees that they were valued more than a computer. He believed that human cashiers were more accurate than a machine (debatable), and that they would know the store and products better when not relying on barcodes.\nThe prevalence of Christian conspiracy theories\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhile the Hobby Lobby barcode theory was debunked, it did renew interest in the bizarre Mark of the Beast/barcodes conspiracy theory. The theory sprung up as early as the 1970s, when the use of barcodes started becoming more commercialized. George Laurer was credited with incorporating barcodes into the retail industry by modifying Woodland’s original design into the barcodes we’re familiar with today. However, he recalled  that accused him of carrying out the Beast’s orders, and spent lots of time denying claims that the Beast’s number, 666, was hidden in every barcode. Who knew Satan liked writing letters?\nWhile it seems laughable that people would think these codes were satanic symbols, conspiracy theories do have a tendency to rise during social unrest. Christians are  to conspiracy theories, and the Christian Right often uses this to its advantage, employing paranoia and perceived cultural threats to foster conspiracy-like thinking and hysteria to gain power. So think about that next time you’re buying a pack of gum from the corner store.\n(featured image: Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n* * *\n_The Mary Sue is supported by our audience.

        "Question": "What insights do former employees provide about Hobby Lobby's barcode policy and its connection to the mark of the beast?",
        "Answer": "Former employees of Hobby Lobby provide valuable insights into the company's barcode policy and its rumored connection to the \"mark of the beast.\" Key points from their comments suggest that the primary reason for Hobby Lobby's refusal to use barcodes is rooted in the beliefs of its CEO, David Green, who values human interaction over technology. 1. **Human Interaction Over Technology**: A former employee, Seth, mentioned that David Green “just really believes in the power of humans over computers.” This reflects a corporate philosophy that prioritizes personal engagement and manual processes in operations, rather than relying on automated systems like barcodes. Seth also noted that while some people claim the decision is based on religious beliefs surrounding barcodes as the \"mark of the beast,\" he argues that this is an oversimplification. Instead, the ethos appears to stem from a desire to enhance the role and importance of employees within the company. 2. **Manual Processes**: Other former workers echoed Seth’s sentiments, highlighting that cashiers at Hobby Lobby must manually enter prices and remember sales and discounts each week. This means they face significant challenges during checkout, often leading to frustrations for both cashiers and customers. Employees indicated that the absence of barcodes complicates the checkout process and may cause inefficiencies that detract from customer experience. 3. **Official Statements and Speculation**: The theory connecting barcodes to the \"mark of the beast\" has circulated since the 1970s, but most discussions around it are speculative. Former employees have refuted the idea that it significantly influences Hobby Lobby's policies, instead underlining that the motivation is about valuing human workers and their roles. Hobby Lobby CEO David Green wrote in his book that employing manual processes helps employees better understand inventory, emphasizing the company’s commitment to a people-first operational model. Overall, the insights from former Hobby Lobby employees suggest that while the idea of barcodes being connected to the \"mark of the beast\" exists in popular culture, it does not appear to be a driving factor in the company's operational choices. Rather, the refusal to use barcodes is more closely linked to a belief in preserving human labor and the hands-on approach to retail that defines Hobby Lobby’s business model.",
