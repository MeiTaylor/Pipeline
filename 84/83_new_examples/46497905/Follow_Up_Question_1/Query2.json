And in the years that followed, an , warning gullible types that the number 666 was hidden in each bar code. George Laurer -- who designed the bar code as we know it today, expanding on Woodland's original idea -- once received a letter via registered mail from someone who claimed to be Satan and asked Laurer how it felt to have carried out his orders.\n\\>'All of this is pure bunk and is no more important than the fact that my first, middle, and last name all have 6 letters.'\n\\-George Laurer\nLaurer -- who has clearly tired of answering questions about the UPC and its supposed connection to the Book of Revelation -- calls all this \"ludicrous.\" But it's also rather amusing. Laurer has  that the three longer \"guide bars\" in each code -- one at the front, one in the middle, and one at the end -- do not represent 6's, hoping to put that urban legend to rest. But you can't squash human nature. If someone wants to find proof that the apocalypse is upon us, they will find it.\nWhen Joe Woodland dreamed up the bar code in the late 1940s, it looked like a bull's-eye -- a series of concentric circles. But although Woodland went to work for IBM in the early '50s and helped Big Blue push the UPC into the market, he sold his original bull's eye patent to another company, and the code IBM settled on looked more like a rectangle -- a series of short, parallel lines.\nThis code was designed by Laurer, and it's what you see on your groceries today. Basically, an optical scanner reads the distance between the edge of each line, and these distances correspond to numbers that can then be used to identify a product.\nMost Popular\n*   ]\n    Science\n    By Paolo Armelli\n*   ]\n    Politics\n    By Makena Kelly\n*   ]\n    Gear\n    By Parker Hall\n*   ]\n    The Big Story\n    By Sandra Upson\nLaurer first realized the code could be construed as some sort of ap...[Content truncated]",

I am thinking about a CBCBI class, instead of during the service, because it allows for questions and discussion.\nThe vaccine is not the mark of the beast. That is ridiculous as is much of what people are saying today about the book of Revelation. Let’s quickly look at the text in question.\nRev 13:14-18 “…for the beast (Nero) that was wounded by the sword and yet lived. And it (Titus, the second beast) was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might even speak and might cause\nthose who would not worship the image of the beast to be slain. Also, it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave,\nto be marked on the right hand or the forehead, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. This calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.”\nI want to simply point a few things out to you. I put Nero in parenthesis because both the early church, and many others, believed that. That is the historic understanding. All the modern views have only been around since the 1850s.\nV3 says that the beast had a “mortal wound” and its “wound was healed”. Nero plunged a knife into his own throat. He recovered, or raised from the dead, as the Romans were told. He was deified and worshipped. The number of Nero’s name was 666 and he was literally called “the beast” during his lifetime. Anyway, I digress.\nThe “mark of the beast” is not “666” as that is the “number of the beast” and has nothing to do with the “mark”. The “mark” is for those V15 who “worship” the beast. Those who did not worship were killed. So, even if this was future, and much of it is not, the mark is tied to the worship of the beast. The Christian will/cannot receive the mark because V8 says those whose names are written in the book of life will not worship the beast. The mark is part of the worship. Also, notice the believer has a different “mark” on their forehead 14:1 which is their Father’s...[Content truncated]",

It is possible that the technology we are seeing today represents the beginning stages of what may eventually be used as the mark of the beast. It is important to realize that a medical implant chip is not the mark of the beast. The mark of the beast will be something given only to those who worship the Antichrist. Having a medical or financial microchip inserted into your right hand or forehead is not the mark of the beast. The mark of the beast will be an end-times identification required by the Antichrist in order to buy or sell, and it will be given only to those who worship the Antichrist.\nMany good expositors of Revelation differ widely as to the exact nature of the mark of the beast. Besides the implanted chip view, other speculations include an ID card, a microchip, a barcode that is tattooed into the skin, or simply a mark that identifies someone as being faithful to the Antichrist’s kingdom. This last view requires the least speculation, since it does not add any more information to what the Bible gives us. In other words, any of these things are possible, but at the same time they are all speculations. We should not spend a lot of time speculating on the precise details.\nThe  is a mystery as well. Some speculated that there was a connection to June 6, 2006—06/06/06. However, in Revelation chapter 13, the number 666 identifies a person, not a date. Revelation 13:18 tells us, “This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is man’s number. His number is 666.” Somehow, the number 666 will identify the Antichrist. For centuries Bible interpreters have been trying to identify certain individuals with 666. Nothing is conclusive. That is why Revelation 13:18 says the number requires wisdom. When the Antichrist is revealed (2 Thessalonians 2:3-4), it will be clear who he is and how the number 666 identifies him.\n**Return to:\nWhat is the mark of the beast?\n**\n##### Subscribe to the\n### Question of the Week\nGet our Question of the Week delivered right to your inbox!",

This calls for wisdom: anyone with decent understanding should calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.”\n> \n> Revelation 13: 16-18\nThe “end times” reading approach treats this passage like a crystal ball. In this approach, the author of Revelation was thousands of years ago gazing into the future, and predicting that some monstrous institution – “the beast” – would force everyone to adopt some practice, one that is somehow associated with the number “666.” And that event would mark the nearness of the end of the world.\nThroughout modern history, some Christians have used this reading approach to claim that a particular institution of the day was the beast predicted by Revelation 13. The institution was usually one that the reader was already suspicious of in the first place. When social security was rolled out in the 1930’s to political controversy, some opponents who were Christians labeled “the beast” as the administration of FDR, and the “mark of the beast” was the assigned social security number.\nIn the 1950’s and 1960’s, when giant telephone companies were seen as part of the shift from agricultural rural life to technological urban life, rural Christians labeled these companies “the beast.”\nThey said the newly assigned three digit area codes were the three digit “mark of the beast.” The same pattern occurred with large financial institutions in the 1970’s with the roll out of credit card numbers, in the 1980’s bar codes and 1990’s with computers and the Internet, in the 2000’s with RFID technology that can track objects, and so on.\nAnd now, it’s happening with the vaccine. The beast is the government, or the CDC, or some other institution. And the vaccine shot itself is the “mark of the beast.” There is even \nThe historical pattern of the crystal ball approach should alert us that something is wrong with this reading approach.

Patheos has the views of the prevalent religions and spiritualities of the world.]\n !\nWhen it comes to the book of Revelation there are ultimately two camps: Futurists (who believe the book tells us something about future events that have not happened yet) and Preterists (who believe the book told First Century Christians about events that would “soon come to pass” in their lifetime).\nI am not a Futurist. As such, I read the book of Revelation as a prophecy about events that have already taken place (from our perspective) and were fulfilled soon after John wrote them during the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70.\nBecause of my perspective, I do not believe that the “Mark of the Beast” has anything to do with current or future events. So, when friends of mine post links to Facebook about a new computer chip that allows people to store their medical records, or purchase products by placing the chip under a scanner, I do not equate this with the end of the world, the rise of the Anti-Christ, or the Mark of the Beast.\nSince people seem to be very interested in this topic, I wanted to at least provide a different perspective to help balance things out a bit.\n**The Mark of the Beast**\nWhen John wrote the epistle of Revelation to the seven churches, he made it very clear – on numerous occasions – that the prophecies contained in his letter were to take place “soon”.\nFor example: In verse 1, John says: _“The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show to His bond-servants, the things which must shortly take place….”_\nIn verse 3 he says: _“…. and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near.”_\nJohn uses specific words in the Greek throughout his epistle which mean: “Shortly”, “Without delay”, “Soon”, “In a short time”, “Near”, “About to”, etc.\nThere can be little doubt, therefore, that the First Century Christians who received and read John’s letter understood at least one thing: They were reading about events that were about to happen very, very soon.\nKeeping this in mind, let’s see if we can identify “The Beast” from Revelation. First, since John is writing to First Century Christians about events that were about to happen quickly, then we can be sure that “The Beast” was...[Content truncated]",

Gentry, Jr.\nOnce again I am offering some succinct answers to a reader’s question. Sometimes brevity can more quickly assist our understanding. (But please do not tell the publisher of my upcoming 1700 page commentary on Revelation.) Here is today’s question and brief answer.\n**Reader’s question**\nWhat is the “Mark of the Beast”? And since your answer will obviously have to have some first century application, isn’t it at all curious to you that for the first time in human history — with microchips, retinal scanners, a growing one-world economy, etc.—that the technology exists to make the “Mark of the Beast” a reality?\n**My response**:\nThanks for your question. This type of thinking is fairly common in our American dispensationalist-dominated religious environment. However, I believe it is quite erroneous. The computer technology of today does not fit the requirements of the text of Revelation for the several reasons.!\n* * *\n (DVD by Ken Gentry)\nA biblical and historical argument for Nero being the beast of Revelation. Professionally recorded and edited with Question and Answers session.\nSee more study materials at: \n* * *\nBut first, let’s look at Rev 13:18: “Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.” Does this require computer technology? I do not believe so.\n1.  We must read this statement in its own literary setting. The mark of the Beast is no more a literal mark than the mark of the Lamb in the next few verse. In Rev 14:1 we read: “Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.”\nI have never heard anyone teaching that the followers of the Lamb during the (supposed future) great tribulation will have a computer chip on their foreheads which holds the name of the Lamb in it.\n2.  In fact, this mark is actually an image of dominion and control. Notice that in Rev 13 no one may buy or sell without the mark (13:17). And note also that...[Content truncated]",
