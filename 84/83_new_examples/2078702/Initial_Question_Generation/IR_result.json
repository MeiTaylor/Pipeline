Take escaping when your wrists are duct-taped in front of you. (Kidnappers like duct tape because it's cheap and strong and raises little suspicion when purchased, and they generally bind your wrists in front so that you're less likely to stumble and fall when they need to move you quickly.) Hanson's instructions are all about speed and angle rather than raw strength: Put your hands above your head, arms angled like the roof of a house, then rapidly move them down and apart. Get the angle right and the tape snaps like paper. Do it wrong—arms down and then apart, like you're elbowing someone behind you—and it doesn't. I broke free on the first try, much to my expletive-laden surprise. (One of the more muscle-bound attendees didn't—score one for the dad bod!)\nBut this isMotorTrend, notDuctTapeTrend, and I imagine you want to hear about the evasive driving stuff, which is arguably the most important part of the course. After all, the bad guys can't snatch you if they can't catch you.\nThe course starts by covering the basics of car control using a slalom course on a dirt road; dirt is preferred because it's slipperier than pavement. The object is to learn what it feels like when the car loses grip so that you can quickly recover. There's a twist, though: Normally one can establish a good rhythm on a slalom, but we can't do that here, because Hanson and his team reposition the cones slightly between runs. No two escape scenarios are the same, he points out, and the variable nature of the slalom requires careful adjustment of your line—but you can't fixate on the cones, because as any racing instructor and Hanson will tell you, whatever you look at, you will drive into.\nThe slalom is followed by the obstacle avoidance maneuver, with a coned-off lane similar in size to a narrow European street (because all the best people get kidnapped in Europe) and a rectangle of cones representing an obstacle such as a car blocking the road. The technique seems straightforward enough—approach, swerve, and recover—but it's easy to panic and pick up too much speed, making it more likely you'll spin the car in the recovery.\nSee All 38 Photos\nOnce we got...[Content truncated]",

Based on those grade levels and the assigned geographic area, the 2010 starting salary range is $43,964 - $74,891.\n> An additional 25% Law Enforcement Availability Pay (LEAP) will be added to locality pay. While assigned to field offices special agents are normally assigned to work a 40-hour (normal business) workweek (e.g., 9:00 a.m.- 5:30 p.m.), Monday through Friday. Due to the receipt of LEAP, special agents usually work an average of two additional hours per day. During certain assignment the hours worked by special agents will vary depending on the nature of these assignments, which include, but are not limited to, conducting criminal investigative and protective assignments and/or being assigned to a protective detail. Special agents are required to work hours other than normal business hours (e.g., 12 a.m.-8 a.m., 4 p.m.-12 a.m., 10 a.m.-6 p.m., 6 a.m.-2 p.m., 2 p.m.-10 p.m., etc.) with the addition to 2 or more LEAP hours, on a daily basis.\nTraining\n> Special agent trainees must successfully complete the 10 week Federal Law Enforcement Training Center's (FLETC) Basic Criminal Investigator Training program in Glynco, Georgia, and the 17-week Special Agent Basic Training program at the James J. Rowley Training Center outside Washington, D.C.\n> Failure to pass either training program on the first attempt will result in separation from the United States Secret Service.\nOverall, being a Secret Service agent is a huge commitment, beyond the fact that if you go on protection detail or find yourself in undercover situations, you're putting your life on the line.\nEven after he left the Secret Service, when the planes hit the towers on 9/11, his wife got a strange call. The person on the other end was asking for his Secret Service badge number and such. Long story short, despite being retired from the Secret Service, he was almost reactivated into active duty because of 9/11.\nYes, it's a huge commitment. It has to be right for you. The lifestyle has to be manageable and you have to be willing to follow a rather irregular schedule where at a moments notice, you can find yourself in another state, another country, or odd surprises like aircraft carriers and such.\nFor some it's a 40 hour week. For others, it's 30 days, 60...[Content truncated]"

Take escaping when your wrists are duct-taped in front of you. (Kidnappers like duct tape because it's cheap and strong and raises little suspicion when purchased, and they generally bind your wrists in front so that you're less likely to stumble and fall when they need to move you quickly.) Hanson's instructions are all about speed and angle rather than raw strength: Put your hands above your head, arms angled like the roof of a house, then rapidly move them down and apart. Get the angle right and the tape snaps like paper. Do it wrong—arms down and then apart, like you're elbowing someone behind you—and it doesn't. I broke free on the first try, much to my expletive-laden surprise. (One of the more muscle-bound attendees didn't—score one for the dad bod!)\nBut this isMotorTrend, notDuctTapeTrend, and I imagine you want to hear about the evasive driving stuff, which is arguably the most important part of the course. After all, the bad guys can't snatch you if they can't catch you.\nThe course starts by covering the basics of car control using a slalom course on a dirt road; dirt is preferred because it's slipperier than pavement. The object is to learn what it feels like when the car loses grip so that you can quickly recover. There's a twist, though: Normally one can establish a good rhythm on a slalom, but we can't do that here, because Hanson and his team reposition the cones slightly between runs. No two escape scenarios are the same, he points out, and the variable nature of the slalom requires careful adjustment of your line—but you can't fixate on the cones, because as any racing instructor and Hanson will tell you, whatever you look at, you will drive into.\nThe slalom is followed by the obstacle avoidance maneuver, with a coned-off lane similar in size to a narrow European street (because all the best people get kidnapped in Europe) and a rectangle of cones representing an obstacle such as a car blocking the road. The technique seems straightforward enough—approach, swerve, and recover—but it's easy to panic and pick up too much speed, making it more likely you'll spin the car in the recovery.\nSee All 38 Photos\nOnce we got...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "Is there credible evidence that the Secret Service practices advanced reverse escapes at racetracks?",
        "Answer": "Yes, there is credible evidence that the Secret Service practices advanced reverse escapes at racetracks. 1. A video titled \"Secret Services' 'Advanced Reverse Escape' Training In Donald Trump's New Armoured Beast Limo\" showcases the specific training that Secret Service agents undergo. This training involves maneuvering their armored vehicles in scenarios that require advanced driving skills, including reverse escapes, which is a critical component of their protective strategies during potential threats [Query1_evidence_1]. 2. Moreover, the training of Secret Service agents is rigorous and includes various driving techniques necessary for protection duties. Although general training details do not specify racetracks, they illustrate that agent training encompasses a range of evasive driving techniques, which likely includes environments that simulate high-pressure situations, akin to what would occur on a racetrack [Query2_evidence_1]. 3. Additionally, driving schools often cover evasive maneuvers, suggesting that advanced driving and escape techniques are prevalent among security professionals, which hints at the Secret Service's incorporation of such skills in their training programs [Query1_evidence_2].",
