United in our determination to carry out our integrated mission of protection and investigation, we did so with the practiced perfection for which our agency is known throughout the world.\nEvery day, our agency is entrusted with protecting key leaders, locations, and events. In FY 2022, we continued executing our protective responsibilities with 100% incident-free protection while planning, coordinating, and implementing two National Special Security Events, the State of the Union and the 77th United Nations General Assembly.\nThis year the Uniformed Division celebrated its 100th anniversary. This diverse team of highly trained professionals protect key locations in the nation\u2019s capital and travel across the world to secure facilities for U.S. Secret Service protectees. In FY 2022, that included 4,867 protectee visits.\nSecret Service special agents and criminal analysts also protected the integrity of the U.S. financial system from a broad range of fraud, network intrusions, and other cyber-enabled attacks. This past year, Secret Service employees across the globe prevented more than $2.6 billion in cyber financial crime losses and seized more than $41.5 million in counterfeit currency. These achievements are only possible thanks to innovative training, cutting-edge technologies, and robust investigative partnerships. Specifically, collaboration with our partnership resulted in the return of $286 million in fraudulently obtained Economic Injury Disaster Loans to the Small Business Administration, which will ultimately be returned to the most vulnerable Americans.\nTo maintain our standing as one of the world\u2019s preeminent law enforcement organizations, the Secret Service fosters a culture of world-class training and ongoing professional development for all employees. Our agency\u2019s success would not be possible without a cadre of mission support professionals who conducted business processes, secured proper resources, hired new employees, and ensured a safe working environment throughout the year.\nOur workforce diversity is critical to tackling the unique challenges of our integrated mission and to maintaining the strength and stability of the legacy we\u2019ve been building since 1865.

Not true.\nMany are involved in investigations.\nAccording to him, as well as the official Secret Service website:\n> Special agents are generally hired at the GL-7 or GL-9 grade levels depending on qualifications and education. Based on those grade levels and the assigned geographic area, the 2010 starting salary range is $43,964 - $74,891.\n> An additional 25% Law Enforcement Availability Pay (LEAP) will be added to locality pay. While assigned to field offices special agents are normally assigned to work a 40-hour (normal business) workweek (e.g., 9:00 a.m.- 5:30 p.m.), Monday through Friday. Due to the receipt of LEAP, special agents usually work an average of two additional hours per day. During certain assignment the hours worked by special agents will vary depending on the nature of these assignments, which include, but are not limited to, conducting criminal investigative and protective assignments and/or being assigned to a protective detail. Special agents are required to work hours other than normal business hours (e.g., 12 a.m.-8 a.m., 4 p.m.-12 a.m., 10 a.m.-6 p.m., 6 a.m.-2 p.m., 2 p.m.-10 p.m., etc.) with the addition to 2 or more LEAP hours, on a daily basis.\nTraining\n> Special agent trainees must successfully complete the 10 week Federal Law Enforcement Training Center's (FLETC) Basic Criminal Investigator Training program in Glynco, Georgia, and the 17-week Special Agent Basic Training program at the James J. Rowley Training Center outside Washington, D.C.\n> Failure to pass either training program on the first attempt will result in separation from the United States Secret Service.\nOverall, being a Secret Service agent is a huge commitment, beyond the fact that if you go on protection detail or find yourself in undercover situations, you're putting your life on the line.\nEven after he left the Secret Service, when the planes hit the towers on 9/11, his wife got a strange call. The person on the other end was asking for his Secret Service badge number and such. Long story short, despite being retired from the Secret Service, he was almost reactivated into active duty because of 9/11.\nYes, it's a huge commitment. It has to be right for you. The lifestyle has to be manageable and you have to be willing to follow a rather irregular schedule where at a moments notice, you can find yourself in another state, another country, or odd surprises like aircraft carriers and such.\nFor some it's a 40 hour week. For others, it's 30 days, 60...[Content truncated]",
