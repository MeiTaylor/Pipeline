Take escaping when your wrists are duct-taped in front of you. (Kidnappers like duct tape because it's cheap and strong and raises little suspicion when purchased, and they generally bind your wrists in front so that you're less likely to stumble and fall when they need to move you quickly.) Hanson's instructions are all about speed and angle rather than raw strength: Put your hands above your head, arms angled like the roof of a house, then rapidly move them down and apart. Get the angle right and the tape snaps like paper. Do it wrong—arms down and then apart, like you're elbowing someone behind you—and it doesn't. I broke free on the first try, much to my expletive-laden surprise. (One of the more muscle-bound attendees didn't—score one for the dad bod!)\nBut this isMotorTrend, notDuctTapeTrend, and I imagine you want to hear about the evasive driving stuff, which is arguably the most important part of the course. After all, the bad guys can't snatch you if they can't catch you.\nThe course starts by covering the basics of car control using a slalom course on a dirt road; dirt is preferred because it's slipperier than pavement. The object is to learn what it feels like when the car loses grip so that you can quickly recover. There's a twist, though: Normally one can establish a good rhythm on a slalom, but we can't do that here, because Hanson and his team reposition the cones slightly between runs. No two escape scenarios are the same, he points out, and the variable nature of the slalom requires careful adjustment of your line—but you can't fixate on the cones, because as any racing instructor and Hanson will tell you, whatever you look at, you will drive into.\nThe slalom is followed by the obstacle avoidance maneuver, with a coned-off lane similar in size to a narrow European street (because all the best people get kidnapped in Europe) and a rectangle of cones representing an obstacle such as a car blocking the road. The technique seems straightforward enough—approach, swerve, and recover—but it's easy to panic and pick up too much speed, making it more likely you'll spin the car in the recovery.\nSee All 38 Photos\nOnce we got...[Content truncated]",

Needless to say, **your mileage may greatly vary depending on** the **prior knowledge** of each section you already have.\nFor example, I found day 3 (Edge browser exploitation and sandbox escape content) the most difficult, as I had limited exposure to browser exploitation topics before, while the Windows kernel topic, which is generally ranked as the most demanding, was still intense but pretty doable for me given the fact I’m already comfortable with that topic. Here is my personal breakdown of the difficulty level of each day depending on the course content:\n!\nEach day was roughly split in half, half content before lunch and half later, with in-between exercise sections on each topic, gradually building the POC and exploit.\n### Day 1 – Custom Shellcode Creation and VMware Workstation Internals\nWhile I didn’t like the chapter on “Creating Custom Shellcode” in the EXP-301 course, specifically due to the use of Python, CTypes, and the Keystone framework, I can definitely see the improvement they made for AWE. Keep in mind that this section in AWE is only a light 22-page refresher and not an entire dissertation on the topic; they greatly built on top of the knowledge and gently expanded the material that was already present in EXP-301 (58 pages), for instance:\n*   It skips x86 and directly explains x64 shellcoding.\n*   No more Python: Create shellcodes using Visual Studio and assembly instructions.\nIt was definitely **better explained and expressed than EXP-301**; the only downside is that it was not challenging for me. I could bear that, thinking about all the advanced topics I was going to see and reading the material ahead to start formulating questions for the following chapters.\nThe second half of the day was on **VMware Workstation internals**. Even if I had limited experience with hypervisors, it was easy to follow along. The material regarding the Front-End and Back-End allocators...[Content truncated]",

It does not specify that the mega fuse is being \" blown\" or popped, from my experience as a technician with some of the other models I have seen this mega fuse actually develop a crack ( typically caused by road shock/vibration)which can intermittently allow the loss of electrical charge to the battery, I've had them where they test good with an ohm/continuity meter laying on a bench but then with a little pressure applied to each end will test open. Ford does listen and research complaints/concerns with their vehicles and typically will give us( technicians) a heads up once they find a repetitive cause. Here is the service message, hope it helps some of you!\n<table><tbody><tr><td><span><b>May 4 2023</b> New SSM 51598 <a href=\"https://www.fordtechservice.dealerconnection.com/vdirsnet/TSB_SSM/DisplayArticle.aspx?content=/vdirsnet/TSB_SSM/DisplayArticle.aspx&amp;id=51598&amp;lang=EN-US&amp;country=USA&amp;type=SSM&amp;vin=&...[Content truncated]",

I agree that it is frustrating, but Atlassian has repeatedly stated that they won't fix it because it would break backwards compatibility.\nAs described in , a bug report on this subject, the official recommendation/workaround is to use the HTML character sequence for the backslash character:\n&#92;\nYou must be a registered user to add a comment.
