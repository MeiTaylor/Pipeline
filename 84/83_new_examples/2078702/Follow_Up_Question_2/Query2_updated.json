I don't own a firearm or even a decent set of running shoes. (If you see me running, something behind me is on fire.) I am the polar opposite of a survivalist: In the event of a nuclear war, my goal is to die in the initial attack. Barring that, I'll be the guy on the roof with a sign that says, \"Unarmed; house full of money, food, and tools.\"\nSo it is rather unfortunate that I waited until after my plane tickets were booked to read the message in detail and realizeexactlywhat I was in for, which is to learn how to avoid being captured by bad guys\u2014and how to escape if it happens anyway.\nNeither the class nor the teacher was what I expected. I envisioned Hanson as a bulky, shouty, camo-clad man who would rip off his wrap-around sunglasses and fix me with a glare that dismissed me as worthless and weak. Instead, he turned out to be a tidy, well-spoken sort with a physique that was muscular but lean, and thin enough that I feared he'd disappear if he turned sideways. Hanson runs his own security and executive protection business, and while he is not allowed to specifically link them, his course is based on CIA techniques he passed on to spies he recruited\u2014or rather would have done had he actually recruited spies, which of course he did not do and the CIA does not do, or so I have been assured by the stern-looking men in suits who just showed up at my doorstep.\nThe people who take the class are not the militia-wannabe types I envisioned, either. Instead, Hanson's workshops attract folks with well-founded concerns about carjacking or kidnapping-for-ransom, including high-profile executives and high-net-worth individuals (which means me and my fellowMotorTrendstaffers are all safe). For them, getting robbed or snatched is a real concern, and they want to learn how to get away\u2014preferably by car\u2014from a bad situation and how to escape from a worse one.\nSee All 38 Photos\nIt turns out one does not need a steroid-enhanced physique to master the techniques Hanson teaches. Take escaping when your wrists are duct-taped in front of you. (Kidnappers like duct tape because it's cheap and strong and raises little suspicion when purchased, and they generally bind your wrists in front so that you're less likely to stumble and fall when they need to move you quickly.) Hanson's instructions are all about speed and angle rather than raw strength: Put your hands above your head, arms angled like the roof of a house, then rapidly move them down and apart. Get the angle right and the tape...[Content truncated]",

Secret Service agents are responsible for protecting the President, Vice President, their families, and other high-ranking government officials, as well as investigating financial crimes and counterfeiting.\nThe training process for Secret Service agents is rigorous and can take several months to complete. The initial training program, which takes place at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Glynco, Georgia, lasts approximately 7 months. During this time, trainees receive intensive instruction in criminal law, firearms training, physical fitness, and defensive tactics.\nAfter completing the initial training program, new agents go through a period of on-the-job training, which can last up to 18 months. During this time, they work alongside experienced agents and receive further training in specialized areas such as protective intelligence, protective operations, and investigative techniques.\nIn addition to initial training, Secret Service agents are required to complete ongoing training throughout their careers to maintain their skills and stay up-to-date on the latest security and law enforcement techniques.\nThe job of a Secret Service agent can be demanding and stressful, but it can also be rewarding and fulfilling. Agents have the opportunity to work closely with high-level government officials and to play a crucial role in protecting the safety and security of the United States.\nIt's important to note that becoming a Secret Service agent is a highly competitive process, and not everyone who applies will be accepted into the training program. Applicants must meet strict eligibility requirements, including having a clean criminal record, passing a rigorous physical fitness test, and demonstrating a commitment to public service.\n!",
