I don't own a firearm or even a decent set of running shoes. (If you see me running, something behind me is on fire.) I am the polar opposite of a survivalist: In the event of a nuclear war, my goal is to die in the initial attack. Barring that, I'll be the guy on the roof with a sign that says, \"Unarmed; house full of money, food, and tools.\"\nSo it is rather unfortunate that I waited until after my plane tickets were booked to read the message in detail and realizeexactlywhat I was in for, which is to learn how to avoid being captured by bad guys—and how to escape if it happens anyway.\nNeither the class nor the teacher was what I expected. I envisioned Hanson as a bulky, shouty, camo-clad man who would rip off his wrap-around sunglasses and fix me with a glare that dismissed me as worthless and weak. Instead, he turned out to be a tidy, well-spoken sort with a physique that was muscular but lean, and thin enough that I feared he'd disappear if he turned sideways. Hanson runs his own security and executive protection business, and while he is not allowed to specifically link them, his course is based on CIA techniques he passed on to spies he recruited—or rather would have done had he actually recruited spies, which of course he did not do and the CIA does not do, or so I have been assured by the stern-looking men in suits who just showed up at my doorstep.\nThe people who take the class are not the militia-wannabe types I envisioned, either. Instead, Hanson's workshops attract folks with well-founded concerns about carjacking or kidnapping-for-ransom, including high-profile executives and high-net-worth individuals (which means me and my fellowMotorTrendstaffers are all safe). For them, getting robbed or snatched is a real concern, and they want to learn how to get away—preferably by car—from a bad situation and how to escape from a worse one.\nSee All 38 Photos\nIt turns out one does not need a steroid-enhanced physique to master the techniques Hanson teaches. Take escaping when your wrists are duct-taped in front of you. (Kidnappers like duct tape because it's cheap and strong and raises little suspicion when purchased, and they generally bind your wrists in front so that you're less likely to stumble and fall when they need to move you quickly.) Hanson's instructions are all about speed and angle rather than raw strength: Put your hands above your head, arms angled like the roof of a house, then rapidly move them down and apart.

The initial training program, which takes place at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Glynco, Georgia, lasts approximately 7 months. During this time, trainees receive intensive instruction in criminal law, firearms training, physical fitness, and defensive tactics.\nAfter completing the initial training program, new agents go through a period of on-the-job training, which can last up to 18 months. During this time, they work alongside experienced agents and receive further training in specialized areas such as protective intelligence, protective operations, and investigative techniques.\nIn addition to initial training, Secret Service agents are required to complete ongoing training throughout their careers to maintain their skills and stay up-to-date on the latest security and law enforcement techniques.\nThe job of a Secret Service agent can be demanding and stressful, but it can also be rewarding and fulfilling. Agents have the opportunity to work closely with high-level government officials and to play a crucial role in protecting the safety and security of the United States.\nIt's important to note that becoming a Secret Service agent is a highly competitive process, and not everyone who applies will be accepted into the training program. Applicants must meet strict eligibility requirements, including having a clean criminal record, passing a rigorous physical fitness test, and demonstrating a commitment to public service.\n!",

They learn to ram other vehicles without causing injury, stop or turn their cars while driving at high speeds, and drive in reverse at 50 mph.\nThey are taught to use their vehicles-from police-packaged sedans and SUVs to an armored Humvee-as weapons, important tools to keep their protectees safe.\nThe school also purchases 'clunkers' students can use to practice ramming and moving other cars.

Cutting-Edge Curricula.\nOur special agents receive world-class training from seasoned professionals dedicated to mission success and personal development.\nU.S. Secret Service training utilizes cutting-edge curricula designed to enhance recruits’ existing skills and develop new ones critical to the Agency’s “Zero-Fail Mission”. Special agent trainees train alongside individuals that are equally committed and driven.\nDuring the first year of employment, special agent trainees receive several months of formal classroom, fitness, firearms and simulation training.\nThe Secret Service offers career growth and opportunities to make your future as dynamic and rewarding as it can be. Because our highly-trained people are our greatest assets, we empower each individual to realize their full potential and more. We support the varied members of our team with progressive practices that help provide opportunities to further develop skills, follow their interests down new career paths, as well as provide an essential work/life balance.\nNew special agent trainees undergo months of intensive training through established programs at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Glynco, Georgia.\nAgents conduct firearm requalifying at the Rowley Training Center firing range\nA trainee secures his partner during control tactics and use-of-force class.\nSpecial Operations personnel traverse the rope portion of the agency's advanced obstacle course.\nFor agents, upon successful completion of Criminal Investigator Training Program (CITP) at FLETC, this is followed by a 18-week Special Agent Training Course at the Secret Service's training academy outside of Washington, D.C. This course focuses on specific Secret Service policies and procedures associated with the dual responsibilities of investigations and protection. Trainees are provided with basic knowledge and advanced application training in combating counterfeiting, access device fraud and other financial criminal activity, protective intelligence investigations, physical protection techniques, protective advances and emergency medicine. The core curriculum is augmented with extensive training in marksmanship, control tactics, water survival skills and physical fitness.\nSecret Service agents  receive continuous advanced training throughout their careers. In part, this training consists of regular firearms requalification and emergency medicine refresher courses. Agents assigned to protective assignments also participate in unique crisis training simulations that present agents with a variety of \"real world\" emergency situations. Agents assigned to offices in the field have the opportunity to acquire advanced training in the area of criminal investigations and are also encouraged to attend training sessions sponsored by other law enforcement agencies.\nAll Secret Service employees participate in a wide variety of management and individual development courses. Ethics, Diversity, Interpersonal Awareness, Practical Leadership and Introduction to Supervision are among the topics currently offered to all personnel at the Secret Service.\nRecruits are challenged to exceed their personal goals and the...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What details in the video clarify whether the techniques shown are part of Secret Service training?",
        "Answer": "The video in question showcases high-performance driving techniques, including scenes of a black limousine engaging in maneuvers like drifting. However, the specifics of whether these techniques are part of Secret Service training can be determined from several sources of evidence that detail Secret Service training protocols.\n\n1. **Existence of Advanced Driving Training**: Secret Service agents undergo extensive training that includes advanced driving techniques designed to handle specific emergency scenarios. For instance, they learn skills such as the J-turn, where a reversing vehicle is spun 180 degrees to continue forward rapidly. This type of evasive driving training is crucial for safely extracting a protectee from potentially dangerous situations, which aligns with the maneuvers shown in high-speed driving videos like the one referenced [Query1_evidence_1].\n\n2. **Focus on Evasive Driving Techniques**: The training incorporates evasive driving techniques, including driving in reverse at high speeds. This is evident from courses offered at various tactical driving schools, emphasizing the need for security personnel to master skills that would allow them to navigate urgent and threatening scenarios effectively. This broadens the possibility that the skills demonstrated in the video could indeed be related to those taught in Secret Service training assessments [Query1_evidence_2].\n\n3. **General Principles of Protective Driving**: The training provided to the Secret Service emphasizes techniques necessary for protective driving, including rapid escape and maneuvering in tight situations. While the video does not explicitly indicate that it involves Secret Service training, the similarities in driving skills required for both high-speed racing and protective operations suggest a relevant context. It highlights the type of skills that agents learn, such as maneuverability and speed control, which align with the driving techniques depicted in the video [Query1_evidence_3].\n\nIn summary, while the video demonstrates driving techniques that are reflective of what might be taught to Secret Service agents, it does not provide direct evidence of agents participating in racetrack training. Nevertheless, the training they receive does encompass similar skills, underpinning the high likelihood that techniques shown could be part of their curriculum.",
