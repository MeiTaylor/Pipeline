They learn to ram other vehicles without causing injury, stop or turn their cars while driving at high speeds, and drive in reverse at 50 mph.\nThey are taught to use their vehicles-from police-packaged sedans and SUVs to an armored Humvee-as weapons, important tools to keep their protectees safe.\nThe school also purchases 'clunkers' students can use to practice ramming and moving other cars.

Among the techniques is the J-turn, in which the driver spins a reversing vehicle 180 degrees and quickly continues, facing forward, with brisk acceleration.\n**WATCH: 'Beast,' Bus, Motorcycles — Secret Service Has to Drive it All**\n​**Protective driving**\nFor the Secret Service, this is part of “protective driving,” which has one goal: “Safely get the protectee out of the area — the ‘kill zone’ — and to move them to a safe location as quickly and expeditiously as possible,” according to Thomas Murach, Secret Service assistant to the special agent-in-charge.\nEven after the completion of that five-day training, Secret Service personnel are not ready to get behind the wheel of the 9,000-kilogram (9.9-ton) armored presidential stretch limousine known as Cadillac One, or The Beast.\nAnyone driving the president or vice president must have passed a separate, advanced five-day training known as the Protective Operations Driving Course, which has about a 60 percent pass rate.\n“If an agent doesn’t pass...[Content truncated]",

United in our determination to carry out our integrated mission of protection and investigation, we did so with the practiced perfection for which our agency is known throughout the world.\nEvery day, our agency is entrusted with protecting key leaders, locations, and events. In FY 2022, we continued executing our protective responsibilities with 100% incident-free protection while planning, coordinating, and implementing two National Special Security Events, the State of the Union and the 77th United Nations General Assembly.\nThis year the Uniformed Division celebrated its 100th anniversary. This diverse team of highly trained professionals protect key locations in the nation’s capital and travel across the world to secure facilities for U.S. Secret Service protectees. In FY 2022, that included 4,867 protectee visits.\nSecret Service special agents and criminal analysts also protected the integrity of the U.S. financial system from a broad range of fraud, network intrusions, and other cyber-enabled attacks. This past year, Secret Service employees across the globe prevented more than $2.6 billion in cyber financial crime losses and seized more than $41.5 million in counterfeit currency. These achievements are only possible thanks to innovative training, cutting-edge technologies, and robust investigative partnerships. Specifically, collaboration with our partnership resulted in the return of $286 million in fraudulently obtained Economic Injury Disaster Loans to the Small Business Administration, which will ultimately be returned to the most vulnerable Americans.\nTo maintain our standing as one of the world’s preeminent law enforcement organizations, the Secret Service fosters a culture of world-class training and ongoing professional development for all employees. Our agency’s success would not be possible without a cadre of mission support professionals who conducted business processes, secured proper resources, hired new employees, and ensured a safe working environment throughout the year.\nOur workforce diversity is critical to tackling the unique challenges of our integrated mission and to maintaining the strength and stability of the legacy we’ve been building since 1865. As we build on our successes, we honor the past by leveraging the collective knowledge and experiences of those who came before us, respect the present by recognizing the hard work and sacrifices of those currently serving, and...[Content truncated]",

That has become more important of late, as the agency struggles to keep pace with painfully high attrition and the unrelenting workload that fuels it.\n“They are in a vicious cycle,” John Roth, the inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security, said last month as he laid out the Secret Service’s personnel shortfall at a hearing on Capitol Hill. Mr. Roth estimated that the agency needs to increase by 1,700 employees in five years, to 8,200, if it is to properly perform its investigative and better-known protection missions.\nThe way out of that cycle passes though Beltsville, a suburb between Washington and Baltimore where the Secret Service’s training center occupies a 493-acre campus. Past a protected, unmarked gate, would-be special agents and uniformed officers confront simulations of nearly every threat. There are shooting ranges, classrooms, gyms and a mat room, but also a fake town filled with mock snipers, a replica Marine One presidential helicopter and acres of woods for special operations training. \nFor officers and agents, preparation begins — and can well come to an end — with physical fitness. To formally join the agency, they must pass a test that combines push-ups, situps, chin-ups and a mile-and-a-half run. And once on board, they are retested every few months. \nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The first part is the Criminal Investigators Training Program (CITP) delivered by the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), Department of Homeland Security, Glynco, Georgia. The CITP provides fundamental training in the techniques, concepts and methodologies of conducting criminal investigations. Some of the subjects covered in the training include training in firearms, physical techniques, driving techniques, handcuffing, interviewing, surveillance, crime scene management, photography, basic firearms training and federal court procedures.\nThe CITP lasts approximately 12 weeks. Each class consists of 48 students, of whom approximately half are ATF trainees. The remaining portion of the CITP class consists of students from other federal agencies.\nThe CITP requirement may be waived for new hires who have attended the CITP with another federal agency. Successful completion of CITP is mandatory to maintain employment.\nThe second part of training is the Special Agent Basic Training (SABT). SABT for special agent trainees is a demanding and intensive training program that covers a wide range of disciplines including firearms and ammunition identification; firearms trafficking; report writing, interviewing techniques; alcohol/tobacco diversion investigations; explosives and fire/arson investigations; firearms and tactical training, close quarter countermeasures; field operations, undercover techniques; and physical conditioning. The SABT consists of approximately 15 weeks of training with a class of 24 student trainees.\nThe SABT is designed to meet all the foundational requirements of a newly hired ATF special agent trainee...[Content truncated]",

I don't own a firearm or even a decent set of running shoes. (If you see me running, something behind me is on fire.) I am the polar opposite of a survivalist: In the event of a nuclear war, my goal is to die in the initial attack. Barring that, I'll be the guy on the roof with a sign that says, \"Unarmed; house full of money, food, and tools.\"\nSo it is rather unfortunate that I waited until after my plane tickets were booked to read the message in detail and realizeexactlywhat I was in for, which is to learn how to avoid being captured by bad guys—and how to escape if it happens anyway.\nNeither the class nor the teacher was what I expected. I envisioned Hanson as a bulky, shouty, camo-clad man who would rip off his wrap-around sunglasses and fix me with a glare that dismissed me as worthless and weak. Instead, he turned out to be a tidy, well-spoken sort with a physique that was muscular but lean, and thin enough that I feared he'd disappear if he turned sideways. Hanson runs his own security and executive protection business, and while he is not allowed to specifically link them, his course is based on CIA techniques he passed on to spies he recruited—or rather would have done had he actually recruited spies, which of course he did not do and the CIA does not do, or so I have been assured by the stern-looking men in suits who just showed up at my doorstep.\nThe people who take the class are not the militia-wannabe types I envisioned, either. Instead, Hanson's workshops attract folks with well-founded concerns about carjacking or kidnapping-for-ransom, including high-profile executives and high-net-worth individuals (which means me and my fellowMotorTrendstaffers are all safe). For them, getting robbed or snatched is a real concern, and they want to learn how to get away—preferably by car—from a bad situation and how to escape from a worse one.\nSee All 38 Photos\nIt turns out one does not need a steroid-enhanced physique to master the techniques Hanson teaches. Take escaping when your wrists are duct-taped in front of you. (Kidnappers like duct tape because it's cheap and strong and raises little suspicion when purchased, and they generally bind your wrists in front so that you're less likely to stumble and fall when they need to move you quickly.) Hanson's instructions are all about speed and angle rather than raw strength: Put your hands above your head, arms angled like the roof of a house, then rapidly move them down and apart. Get the angle right and the tape...[Content truncated]",
