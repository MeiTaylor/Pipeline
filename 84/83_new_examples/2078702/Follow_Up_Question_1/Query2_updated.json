United in our determination to carry out our integrated mission of protection and investigation, we did so with the practiced perfection for which our agency is known throughout the world.\nEvery day, our agency is entrusted with protecting key leaders, locations, and events. In FY 2022, we continued executing our protective responsibilities with 100% incident-free protection while planning, coordinating, and implementing two National Special Security Events, the State of the Union and the 77th United Nations General Assembly.\nThis year the Uniformed Division celebrated its 100th anniversary. This diverse team of highly trained professionals protect key locations in the nation\u2019s capital and travel across the world to secure facilities for U.S. Secret Service protectees. In FY 2022, that included 4,867 protectee visits.\nSecret Service special agents and criminal analysts also protected the integrity of the U.S. financial system from a broad range of fraud, network intrusions, and other cyber-enabled attacks. This past year, Secret Service employees across the globe prevented more than $2.6 billion in cyber financial crime losses and seized more than $41.5 million in counterfeit currency. These achievements are only possible thanks to innovative training, cutting-edge technologies, and robust investigative partnerships. Specifically, collaboration with our partnership resulted in the return of $286 million in fraudulently obtained Economic Injury Disaster Loans to the Small Business Administration, which will ultimately be returned to the most vulnerable Americans.\nTo maintain our standing as one of the world\u2019s preeminent law enforcement organizations, the Secret Service fosters a culture of world-class training and ongoing professional development for all employees. Our agency\u2019s success would not be possible without a cadre of mission support professionals who conducted business processes, secured proper resources, hired new employees, and ensured a safe working environment throughout the year.\nOur workforce diversity is critical to tackling the unique challenges of our integrated mission and to maintaining the strength and stability of the legacy we\u2019ve been building since 1865. As we build on our successes, we honor the past by leveraging the collective knowledge and experiences of those who came before us, respect the present by recognizing the hard work and sacrifices of those currently serving, and build on our storied past by...[Content truncated]",

Not only are the men and women of the Secret Service serving the country by helping to protect the nation's leaders and financial systems, but in the process, agents are required to travel a lot and are exposed to people and places that most people can only dream of.\nThe Secret Service is unique among federal law enforcement agencies because not only do its agents provide protection for the president and vice president of the United States and their families, former presidents, presidential candidates and visiting heads of state and heads of government to the United States, but they also work criminal investigations - the responsibility for which the agency was first mandated in 1865. Throughout their careers, agents will perform a variety of assignments- both protective and investigative.\n### What do I have to do to become a Secret Service agent?\nApplicants should have either a four-year college degree or a combination of education and criminal investigative experience, be in good physical condition, and have a record that is clear of criminal behavior. Lots of people apply to become Secret Service agents, so the process is very competitive. If you are interested in becoming an agent, you should study very hard in school and always abide by the law.\n### What types of cases does the Secret Service investigate?\nThe Secret Service usually works criminal cases that are related to the nation's financial security. The Secret Service was originally founded in 1865 to suppress counterfeit money and while the agency still spends a lot of time investigating counterfeit money both in the United States and overseas, today's agents also investigate a variety of other financial crimes, including credit card fraud, computer fraud and bank fraud. Even though the Secret Service now relies on computers to help carry out these investigations, agents still go out and ask questions of victims, witnesses and suspects because talking with people is one of the best ways to tell whether people are telling the truth.\nThe Secret Service also investigates people who make threats against...[Content truncated]",

No, the agency's purpose is much more important: it plays a vital role in the protection of the president and his family, as well as the fight against financial crimes.\nThe federal agency was  by President Abraham Lincoln on the same day he was assassinated (April 14, 1865) and was originally created to fight counterfeiting. Its protection duties didn't begin until 1901, after the assassination of President William McKinley.\n**_Today,_** **_there are more than 6,500 members_** of the Secret Service including special agents, Uniformed Division agents and technical, professional and administrative personnel. The canine unit is made up of Belgian Malinois, a small breed from Holland. Dogs are with their Uniformed Division handlers 24/7 and remain with them even after retirement. Agents in the Presidential Protection Division (PPD) are the only ones tasked with protecting the Commander in Chief and their family.\nRegardless of their role, all agents are trained for 11 weeks at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in law, firearms, defensive tactics and report writing. An additional 16 weeks of training is required once they arrive in Washington, DC, which includes advanced driving techniques, physical protection and detecting counterfeit money and credit card fraud.\n#### **While their main responsibilities are no secret, here are a few more things you might not know about the Secret Service and its agents:**\n1.  The president and vice president can\u2019t refuse protection while in office, but once , the president and their spouse can decline lifelong protection and/or hire their own security detail\n2.  When traveling, the president is never more than 10 minutes from a trauma center and  of the president\u2019s blood in case a transfusion is needed\n3.

The president is never alone\u2014an agent is present in the bathroom, at the doctor\u2019s office and all other seemingly private situations\n5.

The first part is the Criminal Investigators Training Program (CITP) delivered by the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), Department of Homeland Security, Glynco, Georgia. The CITP provides fundamental training in the techniques, concepts and methodologies of conducting criminal investigations. Some of the subjects covered in the training include training in firearms, physical techniques, driving techniques, handcuffing, interviewing, surveillance, crime scene management, photography, basic firearms training and federal court procedures.\nThe CITP lasts approximately 12 weeks. Each class consists of 48 students, of whom approximately half are ATF trainees. The remaining portion of the CITP class consists of students from other federal agencies.\nThe CITP requirement may be waived for new hires who have attended the CITP with another federal agency. Successful completion of CITP is mandatory to maintain employment.\nThe second part of training is the Special Agent Basic Training (SABT). SABT for special agent trainees is a demanding and intensive training program that covers a wide range of disciplines including firearms and ammunition identification; firearms trafficking; report writing, interviewing techniques; alcohol/tobacco diversion investigations; explosives and fire/arson investigations; firearms and tactical training, close quarter countermeasures; field operations, undercover techniques; and physical conditioning. The SABT consists of approximately 15 weeks of training with a class of 24 student trainees.\nThe SABT is designed to meet all the foundational requirements of a newly hired ATF special agent trainee...[Content truncated]",
