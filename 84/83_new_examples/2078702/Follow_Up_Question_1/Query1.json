Technology by Samsung.\nBELTSVILLE, Md. — They consider themselves the most elite protection force in the world, as capable of taking a bullet for the president as investigating a complicated financial crime.\nSo when it comes to preparing new members for its ranks, the Secret Service has long made training a high priority. That has become more important of late, as the agency struggles to keep pace with painfully high attrition and the unrelenting workload that fuels it.\n“They are in a vicious cycle,” John Roth, the inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security, said last month as he laid out the Secret Service’s personnel shortfall at a hearing on Capitol Hill. Mr. Roth estimated that the agency needs to increase by 1,700 employees in five years, to 8,200, if it is to properly perform its investigative and better-known protection missions.\nThe way out of that cycle passes though Beltsville, a suburb between Washington and Baltimore where the Secret Service’s training center occupies a 493-acre campus. Past a protected, unmarked gate, would-be special agents and uniformed officers confront simulations of nearly every threat. There are shooting ranges, classrooms, gyms and a mat room, but also a fake town filled with mock snipers, a replica Marine One presidential helicopter and acres of woods for special operations training.\nPhysical Training\n-----------------\nVideo\n!\nSpecial Agent Jessica F. explained the importance of strength and endurance exercises at the Secret Service training center in Maryland.\nFor officers and agents, preparation begins — and can well come to an end — with physical fitness. To formally join the agency, they must pass a test that combines push-ups, situps, chin-ups and a mile-and-a-half run. And once on board, they are retested every few months.\n* * *\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
