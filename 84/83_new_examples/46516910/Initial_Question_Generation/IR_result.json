        "Question": "Was Steve Lee directly involved in the alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results?",
        "Answer": "Yes, Steve Lee was directly involved in the alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia. He is one of 19 co-defendants indicted in a scheme related to the attempted influence of election workers to make false claims about voter fraud. Involvement in the Scheme: Lee, along with co-defendant Trevian Kutti, allegedly pressured election worker Ruby Freeman to confess to committing election fraud. This pressuring effort is a key element of the charges against him, indicating his direct participation in a conspiracy aimed at influencing the electoral process. Specific Actions Taken: The indictment details that Lee made consecutive visits to Freeman's home in December 2020, seeking to influence her regarding the false claims of fraud, which directly ties his actions to the alleged offenses. This hands-on approach underlines his active role rather than merely being a passive participant. Charged Offenses: Lee is charged with multiple counts connected to these attempts to sway Freeman, confirming that the legal system recognizes him as having facilitated efforts to undermine the election integrity.",
