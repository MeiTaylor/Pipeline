The audit found that Biden won by a margin of 11,779 votes.\nMark Meadows, the White House chief of staff at the time, visits Georgia's Cobb County to observe a signature match audit.\nAmid the signature match audit in Cobb County, Trump phones a chief investigator in Raffensperger's office to discuss the audit, telling the investigator they would be praised for finding errors in the vote count, according to an individual familiar with the call.\nIn an hourlong phone call obtained by ABC News, Trump calls Raffensperger and falsely claims that it was \"not possible\" for him to have lost and asks the secretary to \"find 11,780 votes\" -- the exact number Trump needed to win Georgia.\n\"The people of Georgia are angry. The people of the country are angry, and there's nothing wrong with saying that, you know, that you've recalculated,\" Trump says on the call. \"All I want to do is this: I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. ... Fellas, I need 11,000 votes, give me a break.\"\nMeadows was also heard speaking on the call.\nRaffensperger challenged the president's allegations, saying the data Trump is citing about tens of thousands of illegal votes \"is wrong.\"\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis notifies Kemp that her office has launched an investigation into efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election, according to a letter obtained by ABC News.\nThe letter asked state officials to preserve any documents potentially related to the 2020 general election, \"with particular care given to set aside and preserve those that may be evidence of attempts to influence the actions of persons who were administering\" it, which would include Trump's phone call with Raffensperger.\nWillis requests to seat a special grand jury in her probe, according to a letter obtained by ABC News. In the letter to Fulton County Chief Judge Christopher Brasher, Willis wrote that the move is needed because \"a significant number of witnesses and prospective witnesses have refused to cooperate with the investigation absent a subpoena requiring their testimony.\"\nTwenty-six jurors are selected for a special grand jury in Willis' investigation.\nThe special grand jury does not have the ability to return an indictment and can only make recommendations concerning criminal prosecution. Should charges be recommended, it would then be up to Willis to determine whether or not to pursue them.\nNew...[Content truncated]",
