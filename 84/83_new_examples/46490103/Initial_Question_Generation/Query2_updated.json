We\u2019ll discuss your vision for your land.**\nNRCS provides landowners with free technical assistance, or advice, for their land. Common technical assistance includes: resource assessment, practice design and resource monitoring. Your conservation planner will help you determine if financial assistance is right for you.\n### Step 2: Start an Application\n**We\u2019ll walk you through the application process. To get started on applying for financial assistance, we\u2019ll work with you:**\n*   To fill out an AD 1026, which ensures a conservation plan is in place before lands with highly erodible soils are farmed. It also ensures that identified wetland areas are protected.\n*   To meet other eligibility certifications.\nOnce complete, we\u2019ll work with you on the application, or CPA 1200.\nApplications for most programs are accepted on a continuous basis, but they\u2019re considered for funding in different ranking periods. Be sure to ask your local NRCS district conservationist about the deadline for the ranking period to ensure you turn in your application in time.\n### Step 3: Check your eligibility\n**As part of the application process, we\u2019ll check to see if you are eligible. To do this, you\u2019ll need to bring:**\n*   An official tax ID (Social Security number or an employer ID)\n*   A property deed or lease agreement to show you have control of the property; and\n*   A farm number.\nIf you don\u2019t have a farm number, you can get one from USDA\u2019s Farm Service Agency. Typically, the local FSA office is located in the same building as the local NRCS office. You only need a farm number if you\u2019re interested in financial assistance.\n### Step 4: Rank your application\n**NRCS will take a look at the applications and rank them** according to local resource concerns, the amount of conservation benefits the work will provide and the needs of applicants. View \n### Step 5: Implement your plan\n**If you\u2019re selected, you can choose whether to sign the contract for the work to be done.**\nOnce you sign the contract, you\u2019ll be provided standards and specifications for completing the practice or practices, and then you will have a specified amount of time to implement.

A few months ago, he was convicted and sent to prison.\nOr there\u2019s the case of Shan Shi, a Texas-based scientist, also sentenced to prison earlier this year. Shi stole trade secrets regarding syntactic foam, an important naval technology used in submarines. Shi, too, had applied to China\u2019s Thousand Talents Program, and specifically pledged to \u201cdigest\u201d and \u201cabsorb\u201d the relevant technology in the United States. He did this on behalf of Chinese state-owned enterprises, which ultimately planned to put the American company out of business and take over the market.\nIn one of the more galling and egregious aspects of the scheme, the conspirators actually patented in China the very manufacturing process they\u2019d stolen, and then offered their victim American company a joint venture using its own stolen technology. We\u2019re talking about an American company that spent years and millions of dollars developing that technology, and China couldn\u2019t replicate it\u2014so, instead, it paid to have it stolen.\nAnd just two weeks ago, Hao Zhang was convicted of economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, and conspiracy for stealing proprietary information about wireless devices from two U.S. companies. One of those companies had spent over 20 years developing the technology Zhang stole.\nThese cases were among more than a thousand investigations the FBI has into China\u2019s actual and attempted theft of American technology\u2014which is to say nothing of over a thousand more ongoing counterintelligence investigations of other kinds related to China. We\u2019re conducting these kinds of investigations in all 56 of our field offices. And over the past decade, we\u2019ve seen economic espionage cases with a link to China increase by approximately 1,300 percent.\nThe stakes could not be higher, and the potential economic harm to American businesses and the economy as a whole almost defies calculation.\n### Clandestine Efforts\nAs National Security Advisor O\u2019Brien discussed in his June remarks, the Chinese government is also making liberal use of hacking to steal our corporate and personal data\u2014and they\u2019re using both military and non-state hackers to do it. The Equifax intrusion I mentioned just a few moments ago, which led to the indictment of Chinese military personnel, was hardly the only time China stole the sensitive personal information of huge numbers of the American public.\nFor example, did any of you have health insurance through Anthem or one of its associated insurers?

After the United States entered the war, in June 1917, Congress passed the Espionage Act, building on the 1911 law, with important new elements added in.\n!\n !Department of the Army OPSEC poster\nThe Espionage Act broadly sought to crack down on wartime activities considered dangerous or disloyal, including attempts to acquire defense-related information with the intent to harm the United States, or acquire code and signal books, photographs, blueprints, and other such documents with the intention of passing them to America\u2019s enemies. The Act also outlawed false statements intended to interfere with military operations; attempts to incite insubordination or obstruct the recruitment of troops; and false statements promoting the success of America\u2019s enemies.

The USTR launched the statutory review in May 2022 in the lead-up to the four-year anniversary of the tariffs being implemented.\nAt the time, the Biden Administration  that the US may lift some tariffs on Chinese goods to fight inflation. The fact that it has now instead chosen to increase tariffs reflects how the trade relationship between China and the US has evolved in the last two years despite improvements in diplomatic dialogue, as well as the increasingly elevated position of renewables and high-end technologies as a consideration in national security.\nThe proposed tariff increases are as follows:\n*   Battery parts (non-lithium-ion batteries): Increase rate to 25 percent in 2024\n*   Electric vehicles: Increase rate to 100 percent in 2024\n*   Facemasks: Increase rate to 25 percent in 2024\n*   Lithium-ion electrical vehicle batteries: Increase rate to 25 percent in 2024\n*   Lithium-ion non-electrical vehicle batteries: Increase rate to 25 percent in 2026\n*   Medical gloves: Increase rate to 25 percent in 2026\n*   Natural graphite: Increase rate to 25 percent in 2026\n*   Other critical minerals: Increase rate to 25 percent in 2024\n*   Permanent magnets: Increase rate to 25 percent in 2026\n*   Semiconductors: Increase rate to 50 percent in 2025\n*   Ship-to-shore cranes: Increase rate to 25 percent in 2024\n*   Solar cells (whether or not assembled into modules): Increase rate to 50 percent in 2024\n*   Steel and aluminum products: Increase rate to 25 percent in 2024\n*   Syringes and needles: Increase rate to 50 percent in 2024\nIn addition to the tariff rises, the USTR also recommends establishing an \u201cexclusion process\u201d for machinery used in domestic manufacturing, targeting in particular solar manufacturing equipment.\nIn a regular press briefing, Chinese Foreign Spokesperson Wang Wenbin stated that \u201cChina opposes the...[Content truncated]",
