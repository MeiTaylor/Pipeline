    "QA": {
        "Question": "Did President Joe Biden actually claim to have sold state secrets during the meeting in June 2023?",
        "Answer": "Yes, President Joe Biden did make a statement that appeared to claim he sold state secrets during a meeting in June 2023. However, the context of that statement is crucial for understanding its true nature. In a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Biden said, \"I sold a lot of state secrets and a lot of very important things that we shared.\" This remark was followed by laughter, suggesting it was intended to be humorous rather than serious. Importantly, Biden quickly clarified that he was \"kidding\" directly after this comment, hinting it was a light-hearted joke rather than an admission of wrongdoing or actual espionage. Moreover, fact-checking sources have noted that the video clip circulating on social media has been edited in a way that omits this crucial context, leading to a misunderstanding of the President's words. The edited videos often present his joking claim without the clarification that follows, which plays a significant role in properly interpreting his intent. In conclusion, while Biden did say he \"sold\" state secrets, the statement was made in a joking context and followed by laughter, making it clear that it was not a confession but rather a humorous comment.",
