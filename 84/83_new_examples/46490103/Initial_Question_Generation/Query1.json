IRS whistleblowers who investigated Hunter Biden’s evasion of taxes on his $8.3 million in income today exposed the Department of Justice’s politicization and misconduct during the investigation. The Department of Justice prevented investigators from following evidence that could have led to Joe Biden; divulged sensitive information to Hunter Biden’s attorneys; and allowed the clock to run out to prevent charging Hunter Biden with felonies. President Biden’s politically appointed U.S. Attorneys for D.C. and Central District of California denied the U.S. Attorney in Delaware’s request to bring charges, which has now put Hunter Biden on the path to a sweetheart plea deal. Additionally, the IRS whistleblowers’ testimony confirms the Oversight Committee’s findings about the Biden family’s influence peddling schemes.\n**Key Takeaways**\n**The testimony offered by two career IRS whistleblowers shows the DOJ, FBI, and IRS’s investigation of Hunter Biden confirms the Oversight Committee’s findings about the Biden family.**\n*   According to financial records obtained by the Oversight Committee, the Biden family set up over 20 shell companies, most of which were created when Joe Biden was vice president. IRS whistleblowers have confirmed the existence of these companies.\n*   Bank records  so far by the Oversight Committee show the Biden family, their business associates, and their companies received over $10 million from foreign nationals’ and their related companies. The Bidens engaged in many intentionally complicated financial transactions through their associates to hide these payments and avoid scrutiny.\n*   Both the Oversight Committee and whistleblowers have confirmed Hunter received millions of dollars from China, Ukraine, and Romania.

Biden, Jr. \nDear Attorney General Garland: \nEnclosed please find a \"confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions\" I have reached, as required by 28 C.F.R. § 600.8(c). \nAs we previously discussed, at the request of the White Hou se Counsel and personal counsel to President Biden (collectively, \"counsel\"), I ag r ee d. with certain conditions including nondisclosure, to allow counsel to review a draft of the report for purposes of determining whether to assert any claim of privilege, and otherwise providing comments to the Special Counsel's Office. Counsel reviewed a draft of the report on February 3 and 4, 2024. \nEarlier today, counsel submitted to my office the enclosed letter. After reviewing their letter, my team and I corrected the following minor errors: \n• The draft report stated that \"[wJe reviewed the materials that were deemed to be classified at the Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information level when the National Security Council conducted prepublication review for the Reagan Diaries.\" Draft Report n.811. We have amended that sentence by adding \"some of' after the word \"reviewed.\" \n• In Chapter Twelve, the draft report cited Chapter Four in a footnote. Draft Report n.892. We have amended that footnote to read \"See id.; NARA Ai:chivist 1 Tr. at 56-59, 77-78, 81-82, 93-94, 122-23.\" \n• The draft report included a section heading that read, \"MARKED CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT IN SECOND-FLOOR OFFICE.\" Draft Report at 333. We have amended that heading to read, \"MARKED CLASS...[Content truncated]",
