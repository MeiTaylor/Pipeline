It appears this march, or parade, or whatever was intended to be a water event because dozens of balloons are being thrown onto the street. I just don’t think Mike Pence thought he’d be clocked in the dome by a fastball like this.\nSeriously, this takes a lot of skill. It’s surprisingly difficult to throw a water balloon with this much force AND accuracy at the same time. Grip too hard and it’ll pop in your hand, too loose and you’re getting no velocity. Also this was far from a gimme throw and she absolutely nailed it.\nThe adults around her seemed clearly in support of it. You can hear a man say “go,” clearly helping her line up the shot — before gleefully yelling “YOU GOT HIM IN THE HEAD!”\nWhat an absolute champion. Keep an eye on her, MLB — because a future’s contract might be around the corner.\n### Most Read\n1.  \n2.  \n#### Loading comments...\nSign up for the newsletter Sign up for the SB Nation Daily Roundup newsletter!\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA daily roundup...[Content truncated]",

While that would be pretty funny, unfortunately we have to report the story isn't true. \nHere's the video everyone is talking about:\nThe @Mets and @Yankees could certainly use her! pic.twitter.com/2U6HiOErq2\nIt certainly looks like it could be Pence but, it is not. Instead, the target is the man who posted the video, Bruce Blakeman, who is the Nassau County executive. The video comes from the annual Stewart Manor 4th of July parade on Long Island. Longstanding tradition has it that local firemen, officials and families in the village have a big water balloon fight towards the end of the parade. This girl's toss was part of that. \nLet's be real, that girl has an absolute howitzer for an arm. NFL and MLB teams need to be flocking to that town to scout her. But, not, she didn't hit the current GOP presidential candidate. Pence was not in Long Island on the 4th, instead he was in Urbandale, Iowa. \nFor some reason, that rumor began to spread on Friday:\nWatch Mike Pence get smacked in the head by a water balloon! pic.twitter.com/dSoj0XDdYx\ngive this girl the cy young for hitting mike pence in the melon with a water balloon pic.twitter.com/vfurgNF8Z6\nYoung Iowan Girl,Mike Pence Water Balloon Obliteration Mechanicspic.twitter.com/i3eglsNsea\nWhile it might be a better story if it was true, it isn't.

        "Question": "Was there a clear moment in the video showing Mike Pence being hit with a water balloon?",
        "Answer": "No, there was not a clear moment in the video showing Mike Pence being hit with a water balloon. The viral video that circulated online claims to show Pence being hit, but upon closer inspection, it actually features Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman being hit by the water balloon thrown by a young girl during a Fourth of July parade in New York. Additionally, it has been confirmed that Mike Pence was not present at that event; he was in Urbandale, Iowa, on the day of the incident. Therefore, the claim that Pence was hit in the head by a water balloon is false.",
