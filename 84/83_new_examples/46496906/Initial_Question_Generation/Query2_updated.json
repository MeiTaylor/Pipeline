Pence and Carlson  that included voting machines, the Jan. 6 insurrection and military aid to Ukraine \u2014 in which the crowd booed him at one point.\n**Mike Pence after Jan. 6 indictment:**\nIf only that were the end to Pence's troubles.\nA video uploaded to social media later that same afternoon went viral, showing Pence purportedly getting struck by a water balloon as he marched in a parade.\nProblem is, it's not Mike Pence in the video. It was Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman who took a well-tossed water balloon to the back of his cranium during a Fourth of July parade in Stewart Manor, NY.\n\"The water balloons and soaker guns  at the Stewart Manor parade,\" Blakeman said on Facebook, adding that he had fun during the annual event. The girl who threw the balloon at him with such ferocity, Blakeman joked, has a possible future career with the New York Yankees or Mets.\nThe young girl's well-timed shot was part of last week's festivities in New York, according to Blakeman's video. Unless Pence was sweating buckets through his interview Friday with Carlson, he remains dry in Iowa.\n**Summer concerts:**\n\u00a9 2024 www.indystar.com. All rights reserved.",

It appears this march, or parade, or whatever was intended to be a water event because dozens of balloons are being thrown onto the street. I just don\u2019t think Mike Pence thought he\u2019d be clocked in the dome by a fastball like this.\nSeriously, this takes a lot of skill. It\u2019s surprisingly difficult to throw a water balloon with this much force AND accuracy at the same time. Grip too hard and it\u2019ll pop in your hand, too loose and you\u2019re getting no velocity. Also this was far from a gimme throw and she absolutely nailed it.\nThe adults around her seemed clearly in support of it. You can hear a man say \u201cgo,\u201d clearly helping her line up the shot \u2014 before gleefully yelling \u201cYOU GOT HIM IN THE HEAD!\u201d\nWhat an absolute champion. Keep an eye on her, MLB \u2014 because a future\u2019s contract might be around the corner.\n### Most Read\n1.  \n2.  \n#### Loading comments...\nSign up for the newsletter Sign up for the SB Nation Daily Roundup newsletter!\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA daily roundup...[Content truncated]",

That balloon was hurled by a young girl with an absolute cannon. While that would be pretty funny, unfortunately we have to report the story isn't true.\nHere's the video everyone is talking about:\nIt certainly looks like it could be Pence but, it is not. Instead, the target is the man who posted the video, Bruce Blakeman, who is the Nassau County executive. The video comes from the annual Stewart Manor 4th of July parade on Long Island. Longstanding tradition has it that local firemen, officials and families in the village have a big water balloon fight towards the end of the parade. This girl's toss was part of that.\nLet's be real, that girl has an absolute howitzer for an arm.  and  teams need to be flocking to that town to scout her. But, not, she didn't hit the current GOP presidential candidate. Pence was not in Long Island on the 4th, instead .\nFor some reason, that rumor began to spread on Friday:\nWhile it might be a better story if it was true, it isn't. We hate to break up everyone's fun.\nWe did love this analysis from Rob Friedman, though:\nFlawless execution from Pitching Ninja.\n/\nSponsored Content\n(blob:https://www.thebiglead.com/7f74693d7988a4b8a862108f99c17e98)]\nCookie Preferences\n\u00a9 2024  - All Rights Reserved\n  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
