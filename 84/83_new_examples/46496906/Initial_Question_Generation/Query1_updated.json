Pence and Carlson  that included voting machines, the Jan. 6 insurrection and military aid to Ukraine \u2014 in which the crowd booed him at one point.\n**Mike Pence after Jan. 6 indictment:**\nIf only that were the end to Pence's troubles.\nA video uploaded to social media later that same afternoon went viral, showing Pence purportedly getting struck by a water balloon as he marched in a parade.\nProblem is, it's not Mike Pence in the video. It was Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman who took a well-tossed water balloon to the back of his cranium during a Fourth of July parade in Stewart Manor, NY.\n\"The water balloons and soaker guns  at the Stewart Manor parade,\" Blakeman said on Facebook, adding that he had fun during the annual event. The girl who threw the balloon at him with such ferocity, Blakeman joked, has a possible future career with the New York Yankees or Mets.\nThe young girl's well-timed shot was part of last week's festivities in New York, according to Blakeman's video. Unless Pence was sweating buckets through his interview Friday with Carlson, he remains dry in Iowa.\n**Summer concerts:**\n\u00a9 2024 www.indystar.com. All rights reserved.",

That balloon was hurled by a young girl with an absolute cannon. While that would be pretty funny, unfortunately we have to report the story isn't true. \nHere's the video everyone is talking about:\nThe @Mets and @Yankees could certainly use her! pic.twitter.com/2U6HiOErq2\nIt certainly looks like it could be Pence but, it is not. Instead, the target is the man who posted the video, Bruce Blakeman, who is the Nassau County executive. The video comes from the annual Stewart Manor 4th of July parade on Long Island. Longstanding tradition has it that local firemen, officials and families in the village have a big water balloon fight towards the end of the parade. This girl's toss was part of that. \nLet's be real, that girl has an absolute howitzer for an arm. NFL and MLB teams need to be flocking to that town to scout her. But, not, she didn't hit the current GOP presidential candidate. Pence was not in Long Island on the 4th, instead he was in Urbandale, Iowa. \nFor some reason, that rumor began to spread on Friday:\nWatch Mike Pence get smacked in the head by a water balloon! pic.twitter.com/dSoj0XDdYx\ngive this girl the cy young for hitting mike pence in the melon with a water balloon pic.twitter.com/vfurgNF8Z6\nYoung Iowan Girl,Mike Pence Water Balloon Obliteration Mechanicspic.twitter.com/i3eglsNsea\nWhile it might be a better story if it was true, it isn't.
