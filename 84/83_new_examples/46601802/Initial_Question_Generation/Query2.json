I’ve done it all: DIY, day houses, all inclusive packages, you name it. At the end of the day it depends on the gear you have and the people you plan on bringing with, and simply _how much work you want to put in yourself_.\nMany times, I will plan a trip for both. When I bring a big group of people along, like we did with Matt’s Alaska crew, or with my friends and family for my birthday, or my child (like in the video at the top) I try to go all inclusive. When it’s just Matt and I, or a friend or two, it’s all about DIY.\nThankfully resorts like River Bend will have you covered (more on that below).\nOf course some of the best trips are when we make time for _both_.\n**SPECIES TO TARGET**\n---------------------\n!\nGreg Jones with a 60″ sturgeon through the ice at \nIf you are reading this article you are probably thinking of walleye when fishing Lake of the Woods, but it’s not the only species that can draw you to the area.

However, Mintel’s research has highlighted that Gen Z has adopted their own set of more modern eco-behaviours. Gen Z also holds brands accountable for improving their eco-credentials, with 34% agreeing that brands should be boycotted if they do not act on social and environmental issues.\nFinancially independent travellersOver half of UK Gen Z are paying for their own holidays. By taking more financial responsibility for their holidays, they are also becoming bigger decision-makers over their holiday destinations and itineraries. This presents a significant opportunity for travel and holiday operators to provide what this cohort of travellers is looking for. Whilst high inflation is not necessarily preventing Gen Z from going on holiday, it is forcing them to be more mindful of the cost of their trips and 76% of those planning a trip say that the rising cost of living is influencing their holiday plans, such as choosing lower-cost accommodation. In order to attract young travellers, operators should offer flexible payment options. Contiki has responded to this trend and now offers a payment plan that allows customers to pay a £60 initial deposit and then the remaining balance up to 60 days before departure. To further ease the cost of trips, operators could explore offering BNPL options such as Klarna or Clearpay, with 23% of Gen Z already using these services. However, it is important that the risks associated with these services are clearly explained.\nTransparency and sustainable beautyGen Z consumers are increasingly making purchasing decisions based on their ideological values and beliefs. Mintel’s US Gen Z Beauty Consumer report found that over a third of Gen Z adults and 13% of Gen Z teens do not use brands that act unethically, indicating that this generation is choosing to support brands that align with their ethical values. While more brands leverage their eco-ethical position, there is a risk of “greenwashing”, something which Gen Z are attuned to with 58% agreeing that they don’t believe mainstream brands that say they are sustainable. To avoid such accusations, brands should avoid vague language and offer evidence of their sustainable efforts. This desire for authenticity and morality can be seen in other areas as well. Gen Z consumers are pushing back against unrealistic beauty standards, they demand more realistic and attainable representation from brands and will increasingly expect brands to destigmatise flaws. Additionally, the popularity of the social media app BeReal is a testament to Gen Z’s desire for authentic content, as it enables users to share unfiltered photos within a two-minute window.\nPower of virtual experiences for the digital native generationWhile...[Content truncated]",

Others seemed to equate the Hollywood-type sky to an ominous scene from _Independence Day._\nEither way, it's not a sky you see every day here on the SouthCoast, especially lately.\nSeeing a local Tik Tok video catching traction on the platform was also fun.\n\"Nice to see people from New Bedford on here,\" said one commenter.\nI agreed, along with 277 other people who loved the comment.\nOthers suggested the video could prove that Earth is flat, which, of course, isn't true..  Leeroybrowns said \"That's the exact example of a local sun,\" meaning the video seemingly shows clouds passing behind the sun.  Commenters wondered how this could happen if the sun is 93 million miles away.\n\"Galactic mothership,\" said GalacticMe17.\nWhat To Do When Aliens Come To...[Content truncated]",
