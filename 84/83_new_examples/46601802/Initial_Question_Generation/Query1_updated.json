That last word means zero time lapse. A volume of water has density and thermal mass. Heat transfer in this case is mainly conduction. Heat will be removed at the surface very quickly but as the surface freezes it becomes insulation and slows down the transfer process - remember that phase change requires 5x the heat as conduction through the solid ice. No matter what the external temperature is there will be a measurable time laps between start and finish of ice formation.\nSubjecting water to space adds another variabl...[Content truncated]",

It has the same  as the air around it, so it has plenty of surface area to\u00a0expose to a freezing temperature. The large surface area means it's much easier to freeze the water than if it were a liquid ball. This is why it's easier to freeze a thin layer of water than a thick\u00a0sheet of water. It's also the reason you'd freeze to death more slowly curled up into a ball than if you were to lie spread-eagle in the snow.\nWhat to Expect\n--------------\nIf you want to see boiling water turn into snow before you attempt this experiment, view a demonstration on the . The video shows a person holding a pot of boiling water and then tossing the scalding liquid into the air. An instant later you'll see a cloud of snow crystals falling to the ground.\n\"I could watch this all day,\" the announcer says as she introduces the video, which was shot at\u00a0Mount Washington, New Hampshire, the highest mountain in New England. The announcer notes before the video begins that the snow-making folks performed the experiment three times\u2014once with a measuring cup, once with a mug, and once with a pot.\nIdeal Conditions\n----------------\nIn the demonstration video, the temperature of the water was 200 degrees and the temperature outside was a frosty -34.8 degrees. The experimenters said that they had diminished success when the water temperature dropped below 200 degrees and when the outside temperature rose above -25 degrees.\nOf course, if you don't want to go through all of this and you still want to make snow, or if the temperature outside\u00a0is just too warm, you can\u00a0\u00a0using a common polymer while staying warm and toasty indoors.\nCite this Article\nFormat\nYour Citation\nHelmenstine, Anne Marie, Ph.D. \"How to Make Instant Snow From Boiling Water.\" ThoughtCo, Feb. 16, 2021, thoughtco.com/make-instant-snow-from-boiling-water-606062.

If you live in the cold northland, you\u2019ve probably tried this trick before. You boil water, head outside, throw it into the air and watch it turn to snow. It\u2019s great fun for kids (and adults) on a freezing cold winter day.

With a few tricks, you\u2019ll get it right on the second or third throw.\nBefore I give away those hints, how about a little update about what happened in December?\nBasically, December was cold. Below normal. Freezing cold. It was so awesome! The lake started forming lots of ice early on and it\u2019s still going. I\u2019ve already seen grease ice on it and it\u2019s early to see square miles of grease ice. The recent winds broke it all up, but if this cold weather keeps up, it\u2019s going to be a great year for ice formation on the big lake.\nHow to Photograph Boiling Water Turning into Snow\n-------------------------------------------------\n]\nYou may have heard of the recent \u201cPolar Vortex\u201d that invaded the Midwest? It just felt like a normal winter day in Grand Marais. At sunset during the \u201cPolar Vortex,\u201d we hiked down to Devil Track Lake to do the old Minnesotan-throwing-boiling-water-into-the-air-and-watching-it-become-snow trick. We threw it and it became snow. But, this picture caught something special. You can actually see both snow and water droplets, which...[Content truncated]",

That\u2019s not so fun for skiing and snowshoeing, but it\u2019s perfect for trying a neat winter experiment \u2013 turning boiling hot water into frozen steam in just a couple of seconds.\n!Here\u2019s how it works. You fill a thermos with boiling water, and then, making sure you\u2019re not facing the wind, you throw the hot water into the cold. Amazingly, none of it makes it to the ground as liquid water. Instead, it appears to turn into an instant cloud of frozen steam.\nSo, what is going on here?\nBoiling water, being so close to steam, is very energetic, so when you throw it out of the thermos, it splits or breaks into tiny droplets. The droplets now have a large surface area compared to their size, which allows for a lot of evaporation. Each teensy hot droplet is trying to turn into steam.\n!But the air is really cold, and cold air simply can\u2019t hold very much water vapour, so the freshly made steam condenses back into a liquid. But each bit of \u201ccondensate\u201d is still really small, and in the cold, all those little bits quickly freeze. Once that happens, you get an ice cloud that is, literally, very cool!\nCheck out this video of the whole thing in action. From emptying the thermos to the ice cloud disappearing takes about ten seconds!\nThanks to  (a great place to go backcountry skiing!) for a few thermoses of boiling water and the great sunrise venue for the experiment. And thanks to Mark Finlay for exposing...[Content truncated]",

I mean, for me, shaking = adding energy, so it should _warm_ the water, not cool it to the point it will form ice? From this experiment I guess not, and that instead, it more or less 'helps' the remaining energy of the 0\u00b0C water to dissipate, forming ice super quickly. Am I right in my reasoning?\nI'll redo the experiment the next night, trying to take a photo to add it here.\nEdit 1: I've placed the same bottles, with the same warm tap water in them at the same position as yesterday. The upcoming night might even be colder... I'll try to take some photos tomorrow morning.\nEdit 2: Okay, so this morning it wasn't as impressive as yesterday but it happened again:\n] Fig.1 _When you start to empty the bottle, only cold, clear water comes out of it._\nShaking a little, then\n]\nFig.2 _Ice particles have attached to the inside of the bottle as it is being emptied._\n] Fig.3 _Unstructured ice has accumulated on the ground._\nIt's a totally \"wild\" and uncontrolled experiment so it's not as impressive as the videos linked by Philip hereunder.\nHere are the videos from which the screenshots were extracted:  \nI also made a tiny additional observation but this is probably entirely due to chance: because I filled the bottles with warm water yesterday, they were a little depressurized this morning, having kind of a global concave shape.

What's attractive about melting snow instead of carrying water is you can save a lot of weight.\nOne can of fuel can easily give you four liters of water or more, which would be prohibitively heavy to carry up the mountain\u2014especially when you factor in the cruel load of winter camping gear and climbing hardware.\nRegardless, carrying water becomes moot once the temperature drops past a certain magic number and your bag or bottle of water freezes into a solid brick.  So, if you're going to camp in winter, you're going to want to know how to melt snow to get water.  Sounds simple enough, right?\nWell, I've found it's a little tricker than you'd expect.\nMelting snow takes a great deal of energy\u2014ie, fuel.  Efficiency is therefore going to be a priority.  If your melting methods are poor, your water yield per can of fuel will plummet.  Here are a few tips that should make a big difference:\nWind\nAh, beware the wind.  Any wind\u2014and especially a gale\u2014will greatly increase the amount of fuel that it takes to burn a liter of water.  You can try cooking in your tent, but the associated hazards are considerable\u2014and potentially even fatal.  The safer solution is to find other ways to shelter your stove.\nPresumably if it's winter,...[Content truncated]",
