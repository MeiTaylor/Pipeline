That’s not so fun for skiing and snowshoeing, but it’s perfect for trying a neat winter experiment – turning boiling hot water into frozen steam in just a couple of seconds.\n!Here’s how it works. You fill a thermos with boiling water, and then, making sure you’re not facing the wind, you throw the hot water into the cold. Amazingly, none of it makes it to the ground as liquid water. Instead, it appears to turn into an instant cloud of frozen steam.\nSo, what is going on here?\nBoiling water, being so close to steam, is very energetic, so when you throw it out of the thermos, it splits or breaks into tiny droplets. The droplets now have a large surface area compared to their size, which allows for a lot of evaporation. Each teensy hot droplet is trying to turn into steam.\n!But the air is really cold, and cold air simply can’t hold very much water vapour, so the freshly made steam condenses back into a liquid. But each bit of “condensate” is still really small, and in the cold, all those little bits quickly freeze. Once that happens, you get an ice cloud that is, literally, very cool!\nCheck out this video of the whole thing in action. From emptying the thermos to the ice cloud disappearing takes about ten seconds!\nThanks to  (a great place to go backcountry skiing!) for a few thermoses of boiling water and the great sunrise venue for the experiment.

However, Mintel’s research has highlighted that Gen Z has adopted their own set of more modern eco-behaviours. Gen Z also holds brands accountable for improving their eco-credentials, with 34% agreeing that brands should be boycotted if they do not act on social and environmental issues.\nFinancially independent travellersOver half of UK Gen Z are paying for their own holidays. By taking more financial responsibility for their holidays, they are also becoming bigger decision-makers over their holiday destinations and itineraries. This presents a significant opportunity for travel and holiday operators to provide what this cohort of travellers is looking for. Whilst high inflation is not necessarily preventing Gen Z from going on holiday, it is forcing them to be more mindful of the cost of their trips and 76% of those planning a trip say that the rising cost of living is influencing their holiday plans, such as choosing lower-cost accommodation. In order to attract young travellers, operators should offer flexible payment options. Contiki has responded to this trend and now offers a payment plan that allows customers to pay a £60 initial deposit and then the remaining balance up to 60 days before departure. To further ease the cost of trips, operators could explore offering BNPL options such as Klarna or Clearpay, with 23% of Gen Z already using these services. However, it is important that the risks associated with these services are clearly explained.\nTransparency and sustainable beautyGen Z consumers are increasingly making purchasing decisions based on their ideological values and beliefs. Mintel’s US Gen Z Beauty Consumer report found that over a third of Gen Z adults and 13% of Gen Z teens do not use brands that act unethically, indicating that this generation is choosing to support brands that align with their ethical values. While more brands leverage their eco-ethical position, there is a risk of “greenwashing”, something which Gen Z are attuned to with 58% agreeing that they don’t believe mainstream brands that say they are sustainable. To avoid such accusations, brands should avoid vague language and offer evidence of their sustainable efforts. This desire for authenticity and morality can be seen in other areas as well. Gen Z consumers are pushing back against unrealistic beauty standards, they demand more realistic and attainable representation from brands and will increasingly expect brands to destigmatise flaws. Additionally, the popularity of the social media app BeReal is a testament to Gen Z’s desire for authentic content, as it enables users to share unfiltered photos within a two-minute window.\nPower of virtual experiences for the digital native generationWhile...[Content truncated]",

        "Question": "Did the woman actually create a helix shape from ice, as claimed in the video?",
        "Answer": "The claim that the woman created a helix shape from ice in the video appears to be inaccurate based on the available evidence. In the video, she is shown pouring hot water in a spiral pattern, but the actual outcome is the creation of steam that quickly condenses into ice or snow due to the extreme cold of her surroundings. The process of throwing or pouring boiling water into freezing air can produce a cloud of frozen droplets, but this does not guarantee the formation of a distinct ice helix as might be visually interpreted from the video. Evidence from various articles explains the phenomenon of pouring boiling water in extremely cold conditions. It indicates that instead of remaining as liquid, the boiling water rapidly transforms into tiny droplets that freeze almost instantly, creating an effect akin to snow rather than a structured helix shape. This process emphasizes that the main result is a cloud of frozen water rather than an orderly ice formation. The description of the video highlights that while she is creatively engaged with her environment, the focus is on the steam produced and its interaction with the snowy ground rather than the formation of a spiral ice structure. In conclusion, while the woman was indeed pouring hot water which produced visible steam and resulted in a snow-like effect, it does not support the claim that she created a helix shape from ice.",
