Snowstorms also rely\u00a0heavily on temperature, but not necessarily the temperature we feel on the ground. Snow forms when the atmospheric temperature is at or below freezing (0\u00b0C\u00a0or 32\u00b0F). If the ground temperature is at or below freezing, the snow will reach the ground. However, the snow can still reach the ground when the ground temperature is above freezing if the conditions are just right. In this case, snowflakes will begin to melt as they reach this higher temperature layer; the melting creates evaporative cooling, which cools the air immediately around the snowflake. This cooling slows down melting. As a general rule, though, snow will not form if the ground temperature is at least 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F).\nWhile it can be too warm to snow, it cannot be too cold to snow. Snow can occur even at incredibly low temperatures, as long as there is some source of moisture and some way to lift or cool the air. It is true, however, that most heavy snowfalls occur when there is relatively warm air near the ground\u2014typically -9\u00b0C (15\u00b0F) or warmer\u2014since warmer air can hold more water vapor.\nBecause snow formation requires moisture, very cold but very dry areas may rarely receive snow.

Small drops tend to follow the airflow and are carried around the wing. Large,\r\n  heavy drops tend to strike the wing. When a small drop does hit, it will spread back over\r\n  the wing only a small distance. The large drop spreads farther. As for airspeed, the\r\n  number of droplets struck by the aircraft in a certain time increases as the airspeed\r\n  increases. The curvature of the leading edge of the wing also has an effect on the rate of\r\n  catch. Thin wings catch more droplets than do thick wings. The rate of catch is,\r\n  therefore, greatest for an aircraft with thin wings flying at high speed through a cloud\r\n  with large droplets and a high liquid water content.\nNecessary conditions for icing include:\nAir temperatures 0\u00b0C or colder\nNOTE: If an aircraft has been in below freezing temperatures and then is located in above freezing temperatures, the aircraft's surface temperature can remain below freezing for some time. Therefore icing still may be possible in temperatures that are above freezing.\nSupercooled liquid water droplets or wet snowflakes\nNOTE: Supercooled liquid water droplets predominantly found at temperatures ranging from 0\u00b0C to -20\u00b0C. Although rare, small amounts of supercooled water droplets can be found at temperatures as cold as -40\u00b0C. The smaller and purer the droplets, the lower are their freezing points.\nNOTE: When a supercooled droplet strikes an object such as the surface of an aircraft, the impact destroys the internal stability of the droplet and raises its freezing temperature. This is known as aerodynamic heating - the temperature rise resulting from adiabatic compression and friction as the aircraft penetrates the air.\n\n\nHOW ICING AFFECTS THE AIRPLANE\n\nIce collects on and seriously hampers the\r\n  function of not only wings and control surfaces and propellers, but also windscreens and\r\n  canopies, radio antennas, pilot tubes and static vents, carburetors and air intakes.\r\n  Turbine engines are especially vulnerable.

This sets it apart from other forms of ice like icebergs, glaciers, and lake and river ice. Icebergs and glaciers form from snow falling on land. Lake and river ice from fresh water. Lake ice tends to freeze as a smooth layer, while sea ice develops into various shapes because of the constant turbulence of ocean water.\nSea ice forms more slowly than freshwater ice for two main reasons. First, the freezing temperature of salt water is lower than freshwater; ocean temperatures must reach -1.8\u00b0C (28.8\u00b0F) to freeze. Secondly, in contrast to fresh water, the salt in ocean water causes the density of the water to increase as it nears the freezing point. As a result, salt water sinks away from the surface before it cools enough to freeze. Generally, the top 100 to 150 meters (300 to 450 feet) of water must cool to the freezing point for sea ice to form. Furthermore, other factors cause sea ice formation to be a slow process.\n### Stages of ice formation\nAs the ocean water begins to freeze, small needle-like ice crystals called frazil form. These crystals are typically 3 to 4 millimeters (0.12 to 0.16 inches) in diameter. Because salt doesn't freeze, the crystals expel salt into the water, and frazil crystals consist of nearly pure fresh water. Sheets of sea ice form when frazil crystals float to the surface, accumulate and bond together. This process often expels...[Content truncated]",

Depositional frost is also known as white frost or hoar frost. It occurs when the dewpoint (now called the frost point) is below freezing. When this frost forms the water vapor goes directly to the solid state. Depositional frost covers the vegetation, cars, etc. with ice crystal patterns (treelike branching pattern). If the depositional frost is thick enough, it resembles a light snowfall.Frost that forms due to the freezing of liquid water is best referred to as frozen dew. Initially, both the dewpoint and temperature are above freezing when dew forms. Longwave radiational cooling gradually lowers the temperature to at or below freezing during the night. Cold air advection can also do the trick (e.g. Cold front moving through in the middle of the night after dew has formed). Once the temperature falls to freezing, the condensed dew droplets freeze. Frozen dew looks different from white frost. Frozen dew does not have the crystal patterns of white frost. White frost tends to looks whiter while frozen dew tends to look slicker and more difficult to see.\nFrost and frozen dew can delay people in the...[Content truncated]",

Even more important is that warm water is prevented from rising to the surface from the depths of the ocean, due to the much lower salinity of the surface water. Researchers from the University of Gothenburg and elsewhere have described this effect in a new scientific study.\nSea ice forms in the polar regions because it gets so cold in winter. However, cold water is heavier than warm water, so the chilled water should sink and not remain on the surface. This sinking should bring the warmer water back to the surface preventing ice to form in the oceans. Researchers from the University of Gothenburg and elsewhere are now presenting an explanation as to why it is not so. The study is presented in the journal _Science Advances_.\n\"The salinity of the surface water is lower, thanks to the supply of freshwater from melting ice at the poles and precipitation to the ocean. The difference in salinity between the surface water and the deeper water is an important factor for the formation of sea ice at low temperatures at the poles. Without the difference in salinity, the water would not have become stratified, leading to continuous mixing of sea water, thus preventing the formation of ice,\" says Fabien Roquet, professor of physical oceanography at the University of Gothenburg.\n**Difference in salinity creates a \"lid\"**\nThe surface of the...[Content truncated]",

By taking advantage of the polarized neutron scattering technique and by considering a nanosegregated water\u2013glycerol solution, we are able to characterize the key parameters of ice formation at temperatures near and below the calorimetric glass transition of the solution and provide a general rule for estimating the lower temperature limit of water crystallization in a broad range of aqueous solutions. We also show that nanosegregated water in the glassy solution at low temperature is not in a high-density form but in a low-density one.\nAbstract\n--------\nThe proneness of water to crystallize is a major obstacle to understanding its putative exotic behavior in the supercooled state. It also represents a strong practical limitation to cryopreservation of biological systems. Adding some concentration of glycerol, which has a cryoprotective effect preventing, to some degree, water crystallization, has been proposed as a possible way out, provided the concentration is small enough for water to retain some of its bulk character and/or for limiting the damage caused by glycerol on living organisms. Contrary to previous expectations, we show that, in the \u201cmarginal\u201d glycerol molar concentration \u2248 18%, at which vitrification is possible with no crystallization on rapid cooling, water crystallizes upon isothermal annealing even...[Content truncated]",

The responses of living cells to ice formation are of theoretical interest and practical relevance. Stem cells and other viable tissues, which have great potential for use in basic research as well as for many medical applications, cannot be stored with simple cooling or freezing for a long time because ice crystal formation, osmotic shock, and membrane damage during freezing and thawing will cause cell death. The successful cryopreservation of cells and tissues has been gradually increasing in recent years, with the use of cryoprotective agents and temperature control equipment. Continuous understanding of the physical and chemical properties that occur in the freezing and thawing cycle will be necessary for the successful cryopreservation of cells or tissues and their clinical applications. In this review, we briefly address representative cryopreservation processes, such as slow freezing and vitrification, and the available cryoprotective agents. In addition, some adverse effects of cryopreservation are mentioned.\n**Keywords:** cryoinjury, cryopreservation, cryoprotective agent, slow freezing, vitrification\n1.\u2003Introduction\n---------------\nBiological and chemical reactions in living cells are dramatically...[Content truncated]",

Insects are exothermic (cold-blooded), which means they cannot produce their own body heat. In order to survive and thrive in climates such as ours, insects have developed several ways to deal with cold weather.\nThe first strategy is to avoid freezing conditions altogether. The classic example of this is the monarch butterfly, which migrates south in the fall to overwintering sites in Mexico. In the spring, the monarch population makes its way back north. Eventually, the children or grandchildren of last year\u2019s monarchs return to Michigan. Pest insects such as armyworms, earworms, potato leafhoppers and some grain aphids do not survive the winter in Michigan either. Instead, populations continuously reproduce in southern states, and insects move north with spring weather fronts to recolonize northern states.\nInsects that do overwinter in Michigan have ways to survive typical winter weather. Death by freezing isn\u2019t so much related to low temperature itself as it is the result of ice crystals forming in the body. Rapid formation and expansion of ice crystals cause cells\u00a0to burst, resulting...[Content truncated]",
