Conduction\r\n transfers energy within a substance, and convection transfers energy through the vertical movement of the \r\n heated substance. Latent heat is the transfer of energy by transforming the substance itself. As you recall,\r\n water has the ability to exist as liquid, gas or solid. The transformation from liquid to gas is called\r\n evaporation; the reverse process, from gas to liquid, is called condensation; from liquid to solid is known as\r\n solidification (freezing); and from solid to liquid, fusion (melting). Water can also be transformed directly\r\n from solid to gas (sublimation), or the reverse, through a process called deposition. We will see these various processes in \r\n the formation of clouds.\n Clouds are formed when air contains as much water vapor (gas) as it can hold. This is called the saturation\r\n point, and it can be reached in two ways. First, moisture accumulates until it reaches the maximum amount the\r\n volume of air can hold. The other method reduces the temperature of the moisture filled air, which in turn\r\n lowers the amount of moisture it can contain. Saturation, therefore, is reached through evaporation and\r\n condensation, respectively. When saturation occurs, moisture becomes visible water droplets in the form of\r\n fog and clouds. \n It should be noted that condensation by itself does not cause precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, hail). The \r\n moisture in clouds must become heavy enough to succumb to gravity and return to earth's surface. This occurs\r\n through two processes. In cold clouds ice crystals and water droplets exist side by side. Due to an imbalance\r\n of water vapor pressure, the water droplets transfer to the ice crystals. The crystals eventually grow heavy\r\n enough to fall to earth. In the second process, water droplets in warm clouds collide and change their electric\r\n charge. Droplets of unlike charge attract one another and merge, thereby growing until they have sufficient\r\n weight to fall. \n There is no difference between fog and clouds other than altitude. Fog is defined as a visible moisture that\r\n begins at a height lower than 50 feet. If the visible moisture begins at or above 50 feet, it is called a cloud.\r\n Two common types of fog are called radiation fog and advection fog. Radiation fog forms during the night as the\r\n earth's surface cools and the air immediately above it cools in turn by conduction. If the air is moist enough...[Content truncated]",

Most of the water vapor in the atmosphere is contained within the first 10,000 feet or so above the earth's surface. Water vapor also is called moisture.\n### _ABSOLUTE HUMIDITY:_\nAbsolute humidity (expressed as grams of water vapor per cubic meter volume of air) is a measure of the actual amount of water vapor (moisture) in the air, regardless of the air's temperature. The higher the amount of water vapor, the higher the absolute humidity. For example, a maximum of about 30 grams of water vapor can exist in a cubic meter volume of air with a temperature in the middle 80s. SPECIFIC HUMIDITY refers to the weight (amount) of water vapor contained in a unit weight (amount) of air (expressed as grams of water vapor per kilogram of air). Absolute and specific humidity are quite similar in concept.\n### _RELATIVE HUMIDITY:_\nRelative humidity (RH) (expressed as a percent) also measures water vapor, but _RELATIVE_ to the temperature of the air. In other words, it is a measure of the actual amount of water vapor in the air compared to the total amount of vapor that can exist in the air at its current temperature. Warm air can possess more water vapor (moisture) than cold air, so with the same amount of absolute/specific humidity, air will have a HIGHER relative humidity if the air is cooler, and a LOWER relative humidity if the air is warmer. What we \"feel\" outside is the actual amount of moisture (absolute humidity) in the air.\n### _DEWPOINT:_\nMeteorologists routinely consider the \"dewpoint\" temperature (instead of, but analogous to absolute humidity) to evaluate moisture, especially in the spring and summer. The dewpoint temperature, which provides a measure of the actual amount of water vapor in the air, is the temperature to which the air must be cooled in order for that air to be saturated. Although weather conditions affect people differently, in general in the spring and summer, surface dewpoint temperatures in the 50s usually are comfortable to most people, in the 60s are somewhat uncomfortable (humid), and in the 70s are quite uncomfortable (very humid). In the Ohio Valley (including Kentucky), common dewpoints during the summer range from the middle 60s to middle 70s. Dewpoints as high as 80 or the lower 80s have been recorded, which is very oppressive but fortunately relatively rare.

The ocean holds 97% of the total water on the planet; 78% of global  is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapor that falls quickly out of a cloud. This is in contrast to cloud water, which is ice or liquid water that falls slowly enough that it can remain in the air for hours. The main forms of precipitation include drizzle, rain, sleet, snow, graupel and hail. It occurs when a local portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapour and the water condenses.\n\") occurs over the ocean, and it is the source of 86% of global evaporation. Besides affecting the amount of atmospheric  and hence rainfall, evaporation from the sea surface is important in the movement of  in the climate system. Water evaporates from the surface of the ocean, mostly in warm, cloud-free subtropical seas. This cools the surface of the ocean, and the large amount of heat absorbed the ocean partially buffers the  from increasing carbon dioxide and other gases. Water vapor carried by the atmosphere condenses as clouds and falls as rain, mostly in the ITCZ, far from where it evaporated, Condensing water vapor releases  and this drives much of the the atmospheric circulation in the tropics. This latent heat release is an important part of the Earth\u2019s heat balance, and it couples the planet\u2019s energy and water cycles.\nThe major physical components of the global water cycle include the evaporation from the ocean and land surfaces, the transport of water vapor by the atmosphere, precipitation onto the ocean and land surfaces, the net atmospheric transport of water from land areas to ocean, and the return flow of fresh water from the land back into the ocean. The additional components of oceanic water transport are few, including the mixing of fresh water through the oceanic boundary layer, transport by ocean currents, and sea ice processes. On land the situation is considerably more complex, and includes the deposition of rain and snow on land; water flow in ; infiltration of water into the soil and ; storage of water in soil, lakes and streams, and groundwater; polar and glacial ice; and use of water in vegetation and human activities.

Prevention of mold growth indoors can not be achieved without proper moisture control. The following are some of the moisture problems that cause indoor mold growth.\nWater Intrusion\n---------------\nRainwater can enter a building through leaks in walls, windows or the roof. Surface or groundwater may enter when there is poor foundation drainage. Flooding can, of course, cause catastrophic intrusion. In buildings that have slab construction, water can seep or wick up through the cement floor causing mold to grow on carpet pads or carpet backing. The building envelope (walls, windows, floors, roof, etc.) must be well maintained to prevent water from coming in, both to prevent mold growth and to maintain the structural integrity of the building.\nWater Vapor\n-----------\nWhen relative humidity (a temperature-dependent measure of water vapor in air) becomes elevated indoors, building materials and furnishings absorb the moisture. Those damp materials can then provide a good place for mold to grow. If there are no cold-condensing surfaces and the relative humidity (RH) is maintained below 60 percent indoors, there will not be enough water in those materials for mold to grow. However, if the RH stays above 70 percent indoors for extended periods of time, mold will almost certainly grow.\nIn the summer...[Content truncated]",

I bought the rubber pipe insulation and ran the tubing through that. I duct taped wherever there was a seam so everything was tight. I buried this the best I could in the blown in insulation and for extra measure, covered the tubing with roll insulation. (Bought one roll and sliced in the middle.) I drilled a hole in the laundry room ceiling, ran the tubing down and in to the drain. Pump works great and has plenty of oomph.\nThis project was a good 5 hours but it only cost me some long one piece tubing and the rubber pipe insulation.\nNo more half shoddy rig job from the installers.\nHope this helps.\nFollow \nanswered Jan 19, 2016 at 22:07\n]\nDennis S.\n3111 bronze badge\n \u00a0|\u00a0\n2\nAny or all of your ideas will help, it largely depends on your climate and how long of a below freezing stretch you can expect. The drain outlet is supposed to be within some distance of the ground, 18\" I believe, which is why it was configured that way. In areas subject to freezing, all piping carrying water should be run as far as practical inside the heated envelope, so the drop to within some distance of ground should have been done inside. If possible, rerouting the run inside, with only a very short run outside should solve the problem.\nAs BMitch suggests, routing the drain through trap would comply with plumbing codes and is the best solution.\nShortening the pipe could fix the problem entirely since the water may not have time to freeze. In frigid climates though, any water outside will freeze. The high outlet could damage you outside wall finish and be an annoyance to passers by.\nWidening the pipe will require more build up before blockage, so if the freeze periods are not too long, this could work. In frigid climates, it will still block up eventually.\nInsulating the pipe would probably be all that's needed, it has the same effect as shortening the pipe, without wall damage. Actively heating the pipe would certainly work, but is probably only needed in extreme cases. Heat tape that wraps around the pipe and is plugged in to an outlet, with a thermostat to turn off the current above freezing is a common hardware store item in cold climates.\nYou only have to worry about the attic if it gets below freezing in there. Attics, though ventilated with outside air, tend to stay a fair bit warmer than the outside. I would guess that unless you have good runs of outside temperatures consistently below...[Content truncated]",

Arctic climates are highly varied. Individually the factors that affect Arctic climate are important. However, they also interact with each other to produce weather patterns and climate feedbacks, which have effects both within the Arctic region and far beyond the Arctic.\nOne way of thinking about Arctic climate is to consider the Arctic energy budget, or the balance of energy that flows into and out of the Arctic region. Over the course of the year, the atmosphere and ocean move energy northward into the Arctic. Energy escapes by moving through the atmosphere and then to outer space in a process known as radiative cooling. But energy can be added to the atmosphere from the ocean and land or can flow into the ocean and land. These energy flows vary throughout the year.\n### Latitude and sunlight\nIf the axis of Earth's rotation were perfectly perpendicular to the plane of Earth's orbit around the sun, known as the ecliptic, the duration of daylight in every 24-hour period would be uniform across the globe: 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness. Earth's axis is tilted, however, and depending on where\u00a0Earth is on its annual trip around the sun, the Northern Hemisphere is either tilted towards the sun (summer), or tilted away from...[Content truncated]",

One may think it\u2019s something that can be overlooked, but water can cause serious damage to sensitive piping or equipment if left untreated. Corrosion (the gradual destruction of materials, usually metals, by chemical and/or electrochemical reaction with their environment) can occur on the sweating pipe, and the equipment around it, leading to messy leaks and equipment failure. Moisture buildup can also cause mold or mildew to form, or create a slippery workspace. In this article, we will discuss the problem in depth and present our solution.\nWhy Do Pipes \u201cSweat\u201d?\n---------------------\n]\nPipes do not literally sweat, although it appears that way. The condensation that forms on the  or component is actually moisture from the air, not the pipe. Like a cold bottle of soda on a hot day, when humid air comes in contact with a chilled pipe or component the air loses its capacity to hold water vapor, as a result excess water forms into liquid water droplets on or near the cold surface. The condensation process affects piping and components year-round, as furnaces heat the air during the winter months.\nIs It Normal for Pipes to Sweat?\n--------------------------------\nYes, it is normal for pipes to sweat sometimes. Sweating \u2014 or condensation \u2014 occurs when the cold water inside the pipes meets the warm and humid air inside the building. Since the cold water attracts moisture from the warm air, it condenses on the pipes.\nAlthough some condensation is normal, prolonged excess moisture can lead to the breakdown of your pipes' integrity, which could cause mold growth and corrosion...[Content truncated]",
