Mpemba, a Tanzanian student, rediscovered this effect in 1963 while making ice cream, providing the first documented instance that led to further scientific investigation.\n*   Although still debated among scientists, recent studies suggest the Mpemba effect may occur due to differences in how hot and cold water reach thermal equilibrium.\nFor centuries, observant scientists from Aristotle to Descartes have harbored a suspicion that — contrary to all conventional wisdom — hot water can somehow  faster than cold water. But there was no scientific consensus that this conjecture was actually true.\nIn 1963, a Tanzanian physics student named Erasto B. Mpemba (pronounced em-**pem**\\-ba) rekindled the idea via a fluke accident that occurred when he was making ice cream at his school. He seemed to prove what Aristotle and Descartes had suspected: Hot water reaches a  faster than cold water does. He wrote about his observations in a , titled simply \"Cool?\" which gave rise to the term \"Mpemba effect.\" But was Erasto Mpemba correct?

This happens at around -14 F and below and is much more possible in some of the colder U.S. states. But it is more impressive in increasingly colder weather.\nCold air has very little vapor in it, so when you throw the readily steaming boiling water into the air, the water droplets provide an even larger surface area for steam to emit from.

This happens at around -14 F and below and is much more possible in some of the colder U.S. states. But it is more impressive in increasingly colder weather.\nCold air has very little vapor in it, so when you throw the readily steaming boiling water into the air, the water droplets provide an even larger surface area for steam to emit from. The vapor may then precipitate by grabbing on to particles in the air and crystallizing, forming ice and snow particles that rain back to the ground.\n> Boiling water freezing in air .... \n> \n> — Beyond Our Science🔭 (@BO\\_sci) \nWhile it's a unique and fun thing to try during a cold snap, this trick can be very dangerous....[Content truncated]"

It's called the Mpemba effect. makieni/Shutterstock\n###### Key Takeaways\n*   The Mpemba effect suggests hot water can freeze faster than cold water under certain conditions, a phenomenon first observed by Aristotle.\n*   Erasto B. Mpemba, a Tanzanian student, rediscovered this effect in 1963 while making ice cream, providing the first documented instance that led to further scientific investigation.\n*   Although still debated among scientists, recent studies suggest the Mpemba effect may occur due to differences in how hot and cold water reach thermal equilibrium.\nFor centuries, observant scientists from Aristotle to Descartes have harbored a suspicion that — contrary to all conventional wisdom — hot water can somehow  faster than cold water. But there was no scientific consensus that this conjecture was actually true.\nIn 1963, a Tanzanian physics student named Erasto B. Mpemba (pronounced em-**pem**\\-ba) rekindled the idea via a fluke accident that occurred when he was making ice cream at his school. He seemed to prove what Aristotle and Descartes had suspected: Hot water reaches a  faster than cold water does. He wrote about his observations in a , titled simply \"Cool?\" which gave rise to the term \"Mpemba effect.\" But was Erasto Mpemba correct? Does hot water really freeze faster than cold water?\n**Contents**\n1.  \n2.  \n3...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What observable effects confirm the transformation of hot water into ice or snow during the video?",
        "Answer": "In the video featuring the woman in Canada pouring hot water during extremely cold weather, several observable effects illustrate the transformation of hot water into ice or snow.\n\n1. **Instantaneous Cloud Formation**: When the woman pours the hot water into the frigid air, it rapidly transforms into a big white cloud. This is indicative of the boiling water quickly generating steam, which condenses into tiny droplets that freeze almost instantaneously. This phenomenon is widely documented as boiling water thrown into freezing air results in this visual effect, creating the appearance of ice crystals and snow-like particles. \n\n2. **Cooling and Crystallization Effect**: The process that occurs as the boiling water is exposed to the very low temperatures is known to cause the water to break into smaller droplets. As these droplets meet the cold air, they provide a large surface area for rapid cooling and can precipitate into ice crystals, effectively forming snow. This is particularly pronounced in conditions as cold as -14°F or below, validating the dramatic transformation seen in the video.\n\n3. **Scientific Explanation**: The scientific principle at play is that while the hot water itself does not freeze immediately, the process of boiling water being sprayed into cold air leads to a phenomenon where it condenses into fine droplets and then crystallizes. This process provides a vivid demonstration of how heat and cold interact, which is highlighted by researchers who have observed similar experiments. Hot water emits steam more readily, enhancing this effect.\n\n4. **The Mpemba Effect**: The video demonstrates an observable aspect of the Mpemba effect, where hot water can appear to freeze faster than colder water under certain conditions. While the effect might not directly translate to the appearance of a solid ice structure, it highlights the rapid transformation into snow-like precipitation that can result from exposing hot water to extremely cold conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, the observable effects that confirm the transformation of hot water into ice or snow during the video include the formation of a visible steam cloud, crystallization of water droplets in extremely cold air, and the scientific principles that underpin these processes.",
