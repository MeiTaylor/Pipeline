A woman throws hot water into the air, which instantly condenses into steam and ice crystals amid temperatures of -16 F in Shenyang, China, on January 8, 2021. STR/AFP via Getty Images\nWater would have to be -42 F to immediately freeze. What is happening instead is that the hot water is  into water droplets, essentially turning into steam. This happens at around -14 F and below and is much more possible in some of the colder U.S. states. But it is more impressive in increasingly colder weather.\nCold air has very little vapor in it, so when you throw the readily steaming boiling water into the air, the water droplets provide an even larger surface area for steam to emit from. The vapor may then precipitate by grabbing on to particles in the air and crystallizing, forming ice and snow particles that rain back to the ground.\n> Boiling water freezing in air .... \n> \n> \u2014 Beyond Our Science\ud83d\udd2d (@BO\\_sci) \nWhile it's a unique and fun thing to try during a cold snap, this trick can be very dangerous....[Content truncated]",

In the picture above, water was boiled in a pot and taken directly outside to be thrown into the -22 degrees Fahrenheit air. As water reaches its boiling point, the molecules move faster and faster, on the verge of its evaporation point. Hot water evaporates faster than cold water because the molecules in cold water are not moving near as quickly. When you try this same experiment with cold water, it will not have the same effect. Hot water freezes faster than cold water, which is known as the Mpemba effect.\nStudents could:\nHow Does Boiling Water Turn Into Snow? | Science ABC:\u00a0This resource explains why the phenomenon occurs and also the conditions needed for it to occur.\u00a0\nFrozen Bubbles, Instant Ice, and Other Winter Weather Stunts | National Geographic:\u00a0This resource explains how boiling water can turn to vapor and then into ice when you throw it into freezing temperature.

There is disagreement about its theoretical basis and the parameters required to produce the effect.]]\nThe Mpemba effect is named after Tanzanian scientist , who described it in 1963 as a  student. The initial discovery and observations of the effect originate in ancient times;  said that it was common knowledge.]\nThe phenomenon, when taken to mean \"hot water freezes faster than cold\", is difficult to reproduce or confirm because it is ill-defined.] Monwhea Jeng proposed a more precise wording: \"There exists a set of initial parameters, and a pair of temperatures, such that given two bodies of water identical in these parameters, and differing only in initial uniform temperatures, the hot one will freeze sooner.\"]\nEven with Jeng's definition, it is not clear whether \"freezing\" refers to the point at which water forms a visible surface layer of ice, the point at which the entire volume of water becomes a solid block of ice, or when the water reaches 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F; 273\u00a0K).] Jeng's definition suggests simple ways in which the effect might be observed, such as if a warmer temperature melts the frost on a cooling surface, thereby increasing thermal conductivity between the cooling surface and the water...[Content truncated]",
