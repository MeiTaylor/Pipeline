Place both in a freezer and note which one freezes first. Common sense suggests that the colder water will. But luminaries including Aristotle, Rene Descartes and Sir Francis Bacon have all observed that hot water may actually cool more quickly. Likewise, plumbers report hot water pipes bursting in subzero weather while cold ones remain intact. Yet for more than half a century, physicists have been arguing about whether something like this really occurs.\nThe modern term for hot water freezing faster than cold water is the Mpemba effect, named after Erasto Mpemba, a Tanzanian teenager who, along with the physicist Denis Osborne, conducted the first systematic, scientific studies of it in the 1960s. While they were able to observe the effect, follow-up experiments have failed to consistently replicate that result. Precision experiments to investigate freezing can be influenced by many subtle details, and researchers often have trouble determining if they have accounted for all confounding variables.\nOver the past few years, as the controversy continues about whether the Mpemba effect occurs in water, the phenomenon has been spotted in other substances \u2014 crystalline polymers, icelike solids called clathrate hydrates, and manganite minerals cooling in a magnetic field. These new directions are helping researchers peek into the complicated dynamics of systems that are out of thermodynamic equilibrium. A contingent of physicists modeling out-of-equilibrium systems has predicted the Mpemba effect should occur in a wide variety of materials (along with its inverse, in which a cold substance heats up faster than a warm one). Recent experiments appear to confirm these ideas.\nYet the most familiar substance of all, water, is proving to be the slipperiest.\n\u201cA glass of water stuck in a freezer seems simple,\u201d said\u00a0John Bechhoefer, a physicist at Simon Fraser University in Canada whose recent experiments are...[Content truncated]",

Mpemba, a Tanzanian student, rediscovered this effect in 1963 while making ice cream, providing the first documented instance that led to further scientific investigation.\n*   Although still debated among scientists, recent studies suggest the Mpemba effect may occur due to differences in how hot and cold water reach thermal equilibrium.\nFor centuries, observant scientists from Aristotle to Descartes have harbored a suspicion that \u2014 contrary to all conventional wisdom \u2014 hot water can somehow  faster than cold water. But there was no scientific consensus that this conjecture was actually true.\nIn 1963, a Tanzanian physics student named Erasto B. Mpemba (pronounced em-**pem**\\-ba) rekindled the idea via a fluke accident that occurred when he was making ice cream at his school. He seemed to prove what Aristotle and Descartes had suspected: Hot water reaches a  faster than cold water does. He wrote about his observations in a , titled simply \"Cool?\" which gave rise to the term \"Mpemba effect.\" But was Erasto Mpemba correct? Does hot water really freeze faster than cold water?\n**Contents**\n1.  \n2.  \n3...[Content truncated]",

This assertion seems counter-intuitive and yet references to the effect go back at least to the writings of Aristotle. Indeed, at first thought one might consider the effect to breach fundamental thermodynamic laws, but we show that this is not the case. We go on to examine the available evidence for the Mpemba effect and carry out our own experiments by cooling water in carefully controlled conditions. We conclude, somewhat sadly, that there is no evidence to support meaningful observations of the Mpemba effect.",

Such findings therefore offer a route to explaining the Mpemba effect only if they result in a meaningful hysteresis in the thermal or fluid properties of water. A model exhibiting a hysteresis in the cooling of water is presented by ref. 5 which is compared to an observation of the Mpemba effect documented as part of a popular science competition organised by the RSC7 \u2014 we include the experimental observations by ref. 7 within the data analysed in the present study. It is our aim to present an investigation of the history behind the Mpemba effect, examine the scientific evidence for it, consider the underlying physical mechanisms for the effect and determine whether the effect actually exists in any meaningful manner.\nThere is no clear universally accepted scientific definition of the \u2018Mpemba effect\u2019. Mpemba & Osborne8 document the time for freezing to commence while others include the freezing process (for example see ref. 9). This lack of clarity is reflected by the level of discrepancies in the literature, which offers a number of different explanations. Broadly speaking, when two samples of water are cooled to the same temperature, in the same manner with the two samples being identical except for their initial temperature, and the initially hotter sample cools in less time, one can consider the Mpemba effect to have been observed. The temperature at which cooling times are compared has often been chosen to be 0\u2009\u00b0C (or below) making careful measurements more difficult because of the phase change that occurs as water freezes.\nObservations of hot water freezing in less time than cold water date back to classical science. Aristotle10 noted that the ancient Greeks of Pontus exploited the effects when they encamped on the ice to fish, and similar observations have been repeated by Bacon11 and Descartes12. More modern awareness of this apparent anomaly range from the accidental experiments of the Tanzanian school boy, Mpemba (after whom the phenomenon is popularly known8), to the competition calling for explanations of the phenomenon by the RSC.\nThe Mpemba effect is an oft cited scientific anomaly and has been widely used in high-school and undergraduate physics projects13,14. The effect may appear anomalous since on first consideration one might regard the first law of thermodynamics to be breached. An interpretation of the first law is that the change in the internal energy of a closed system is equal to the amount of heat supplied (accounting for any work done on or by the system).

There is disagreement about its theoretical basis and the parameters required to produce the effect.]]\nThe Mpemba effect is named after Tanzanian scientist , who described it in 1963 as a  student. The initial discovery and observations of the effect originate in ancient times;  said that it was common knowledge.]\nThe phenomenon, when taken to mean \"hot water freezes faster than cold\", is difficult to reproduce or confirm because it is ill-defined.] Monwhea Jeng proposed a more precise wording: \"There exists a set of initial parameters, and a pair of temperatures, such that given two bodies of water identical in these parameters, and differing only in initial uniform temperatures, the hot one will freeze sooner.\"]\nEven with Jeng's definition, it is not clear whether \"freezing\" refers to the point at which water forms a visible surface layer of ice, the point at which the entire volume of water becomes a solid block of ice, or when the water reaches 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F; 273\u00a0K).] Jeng's definition suggests simple ways in which the effect might be observed, such as if a warmer temperature melts the frost on a cooling surface, thereby increasing thermal conductivity between the cooling surface and the water...[Content truncated]",

This counterintuitive fact has been known at least since , approximately 2,300 years ago; more recently, it was rediscovered by Erasto Mpemba, a Tanzanian high school student, who, together with physicist Denis Osborne, first investigated it in the 1960s. Their paper, published in Physics Education in 1969, was appropriately titled \u201cCool?\u201d A few months ago, a trend consisting of throwing boiling water into the air to see it quickly freeze and turn into snow went viral on social media.\n> Hot water freezes faster than cold water      \n> \n> \nThere has been some controversy regarding this phenomenon, as consistently replicating the result in the laboratory has proven difficult.

Some parts of the U.S., such as the west, Alaska, and Northeast region have experienced greater warming than the rest of the country.\nThe annual statewide average temperature in New York has warmed 3\u00b0F (0.6\u00b0F per decade) since 1970. The state's average temperatures are projected to rise by as much as another 3\u00b0F by 2080 with the greatest warming occurring in the northern parts of the state. Rising annual temperatures are already having widespread impacts on New York's communities and ecosystems and impacts are expected to increase. New York State's changing climate may no longer be able to support the types of plants, insects, and wildlife living in New York, particularly those in high-elevation regions like the Catskills and Adirondacks. As New York's temperatures increase, these species will extend their range north, impacting the industries and economies that depend on them such as fishing, hunting, and tourism.\nAcross the northeastern U.S., winters are warming faster than any other season. Over the last century, average winter temperatures have increased by approximately 3\u00b0F, spring temperatures by 2\u00b0F, and summer and fall temperatures by 1.4\u00b0F.\nIn New York, winters have warmed three times faster than summers. Warmer winter temperatures, with fewer days below freezing, are bringing more winter precipitation to New York as rain, less snow, reduced snow cover, and earlier spring snowmelt. Less snowfall and earlier snowmelt are already having and will continue to have increasing economic impacts on New York's winter recreation industry. Reduced snow cover will increase the vulnerability of certain plants that depend on snow for insulation, and wildlife that depend on snow for protection from predators during the winter. Less snowfall in the winter can also cause drier summer soil conditions, increasing the risk of wildfires. Lake effect snow will increase snowfall amounts in the next few decades for parts of New York State, as warmer winters continue to cause less ice cover on Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and the Finger Lakes. However, lake-effect snow will eventually decrease with continued global warming, as temperatures below freezing in New York become less frequent and more winter precipitation falls as rain.\nWarmer winters in New York are also affecting the winter-spring season transition, impacting the timing of blooming for trees and flowers which migrating and hibernating wildlife depend on for food. Changes to the timing of the winter-spring transition can also impact agriculture by extending the length of the growing season, with the last frost of winter occurring earlier in...[Content truncated]",
