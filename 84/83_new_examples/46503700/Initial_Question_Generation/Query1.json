In the video, you can see that Biden was looking at children's books, not on mental health.\nDementia mostly manifests itself in old age. This is how propagandists hinted that Joseph Biden was allegedly ill and, for example, unfit to serve as president.\n**\"Victory-Flavored Pringles\"**\nAnalysts from Detector Media  the disinformation circulating that Pringles has released a \"victory flavor\" in Russia. These reports suggest that the international brand expressed its support for Russia by featuring a St. George's ribbon on the chip container, backed up with video evidence.\nYet, post the full-scale Russian incursion into Ukraine, Kellogg's, the parent company of Pringles, ceased its product distribution in Russia. In fact, by December 2022, Kellogg's had divested its facilities to a local manufacturer; hence the brand's products shouldn't be available in Russian stores.\nThe narrative of \"victory-flavored\" Pringles seems restricted to Russian social media, and these specific products are conspicuously absent from Russian marketplaces. The authenticity of the video is suspect, as it's plausible that the Pringles tube showcasing the St. George's ribbon was digitally fabricated.\n**\"Stop Zelenskyy, Stop the War\"**\nPropaganda media and anonymous Telegram channels  a fake that a billboard in Japan carried the message \"Stop Zelenskyy, Stop the War,\" substantiated by a video clip.\nHowever, close examination reveals that the video was doctored. The , dating back two years, depicted Tokyo's Shibuya district during nighttime. A digital superimposition of the controversial message was added to the actual billboard in the original footage.\nThis deceptive narrative aims to undermine international support for Ukraine and to falsely portray Ukraine and its leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as the instigators of the war with Russia.\n**\"Ukrainian Army’s Staged Videos\"**\nRecently, a video  in Russian media purporting to depict Ukrainian soldiers creating staged content tailored for a Western viewership. In this footage, two uniformed soldiers are seen moving a mannequin behind a tree as a woman captures the scene with her camera.\nThe  was posted on the Facebook page of the NGO \"Training Center 12\" based in Kremenchuk. Accompanying the video was the caption: \"Basic military training of civilians by NGO NTTs 12\". Thus, it's clear that the video documents civilian training exercises, not any orchestrated efforts by the Ukrainian military.\nRussian propaganda frequently asserts that Russia...[Content truncated]",
