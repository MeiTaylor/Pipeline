It was shared on Facebook more than 50 times, according to CrowdTangle, a social media analytics tool.\n**Follow us on Facebook!**\nOur rating: Altered\n-------------------\nThe video was altered to include the anti-Zelenskyy billboard. The original video shows a different advertisement in its place, and it was posted online more than a year before Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nVideo edited to include anti-Zelenskyy display\n----------------------------------------------\nThe clip in the post was taken from a  uploaded to YouTube on Oct. 18, 2020, by a verified account called \"Virtual Japan,\" which posts  in Japan.\nIt shows the same buildings, vehicles and people as the clip in the post, but the digital billboard in question does not show a message critical of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Instead, it shows white Japanese writing on a pink background followed by images of people.\nAn image of the intersection in Shibuya City, Tokyo, taken in October 2022 can be seen on  . The billboard in that image does not show an anti-Zelenskyy billboard either.\n...[Content truncated]",

Congress avoided a government shutdown by passing a  that will fund the government through mid-November but the omission of aid to Ukraine was notable. This happened, in part, because there is a  on the United States’ continued support for Ukraine and a  to oppose any stopgap measures or bills that allocate additional funding for Kyiv.\nA September 7-18 survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs shows that majorities of Americans support continued US economic assistance and military transfers to Ukraine, but those majorities have narrowed since last November.

Six in 10 Republicans say it has not been worth it.\n*   As in November 2022, about half the public thinks the United States should support Ukraine for as long as it takes even if it means higher prices for US households (47%). The other half prefers that the United States encourage Ukraine to negotiate even if it loses territory (49%). A majority of Republicans say that the United States should encourage negotiation (66%).\n*   But in response to a separate question that does not explicitly mention the costs to US households, nearly six in 10 Americans say the United States should continue to provide arms and military supplies to Ukraine until it has reclaimed all of its territory (57%).

It's called solar geo-engineering and involves atmospheric aerosol injection of tiny reflective particles to reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the earth and thus cool the planet.\nSimilarly, successful weather modification efforts have been localised - and certainly not on the grand scale some conspiracy theorists claim.\nNonetheless, \"chemtrail\" and geo-engineering conspiracy theorists flood social media with speculation, questions and images of contrail cross-hatched skies.  suggested almost 17% of respondents thought chemtrail conspiracy theories true or partly true.\nSuzanne says she first became aware of the subject six years ago.\n\"I was actually on a website. It was a very young girl, she wasn't even ten years old. She talked about the spraying going on in our skies and the fact she was so sad because she didn't want to go outside and the skies were no longer blue and we were being sprayed. Why would such a young child be sharing this information if it wasn't truthful?\n\"Her words disturbed me and intrigued me so I began looking into this topic and doing extensive research. This awakening truly changed my life,\" she says.\n!Suzanne Maher\nSuzanne Maher in front of a Bye Bye Blue Sky billboard in Toronto\nThat research led Suzanne to create Bye Bye Blue Sky. She runs a closed group on Facebook, where around 5,000 fellow believers can discuss the theory, as well as raising money to buy billboard advertising. She closely vets the group's members.\n\"We don't debate that it's happening in this group,\" she says. \"We all realise that it is happening.\"\n'Information bubbles'\n---------------------\nClosed groups of like-minded people - the type common on social media and the internet - are one of the big reasons why conspiracy theories solidify online. Professor Karen Douglas, from the University of Kent, researches the psychology of conspiracy theories.\n\"People tend to share information but also consume information that's consistent with what they already believe,\" she says.\n\"People end up living in these information bubbles, or echo chambers, where they share ideas with other people who believe what they believe. And they read information which confirms what they believe.\n\"Information doesn't necessarily spread indiscriminately the way people think it does on the internet and social media. People tend to share it with people who kind of think the same way as they do about these issues in the first place,\" she says.\n'I taste and smell it'\n----------------------\nRuss Tanner runs...[Content truncated]",
