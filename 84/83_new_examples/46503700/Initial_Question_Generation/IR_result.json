These reports suggest that the international brand expressed its support for Russia by featuring a St. George's ribbon on the chip container, backed up with video evidence.\nYet, post the full-scale Russian incursion into Ukraine, Kellogg's, the parent company of Pringles, ceased its product distribution in Russia. In fact, by December 2022, Kellogg's had divested its facilities to a local manufacturer; hence the brand's products shouldn't be available in Russian stores.\nThe narrative of \"victory-flavored\" Pringles seems restricted to Russian social media, and these specific products are conspicuously absent from Russian marketplaces.

In the video, you can see that Biden was looking at children's books, not on mental health.\nDementia mostly manifests itself in old age. This is how propagandists hinted that Joseph Biden was allegedly ill and, for example, unfit to serve as president.\n**\"Victory-Flavored Pringles\"**\nAnalysts from Detector Media  the disinformation circulating that Pringles has released a \"victory flavor\" in Russia. These reports suggest that the international brand expressed its support for Russia by featuring a St. George's ribbon on the chip container, backed up with video evidence.\nYet, post the full-scale Russian incursion into Ukraine, Kellogg's, the parent company of Pringles, ceased its product distribution in Russia. In fact, by December 2022, Kellogg's had divested its facilities to a local manufacturer; hence the brand's products shouldn't be available in Russian stores.\nThe narrative of \"victory-flavored\" Pringles seems restricted to Russian social media, and these specific products are conspicuously absent from Russian marketplaces. The authenticity of the video is suspect, as it's plausible that the Pringles tube showcasing the St. George's ribbon was digitally fabricated.\n**\"Stop Zelenskyy, Stop the War\"**\nPropaganda media and anonymous Telegram channels  a fake that a billboard in Japan carried the message \"Stop Zelenskyy, Stop the War,\" substantiated by a video clip.\nHowever, close examination reveals that the video was doctored. The , dating back two years, depicted Tokyo's Shibuya district during nighttime. A digital superimposition of the controversial message was added to the actual billboard in the original footage.\nThis deceptive narrative aims to undermine international support for Ukraine and to falsely portray Ukraine and its leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as the instigators of the war with Russia.\n**\"Ukrainian Army’s Staged Videos\"**\nRecently, a video  in Russian media purporting to depict Ukrainian soldiers creating staged content tailored for a Western viewership.

        "Question": "Is there evidence that the billboard saying \"Stop Zelenskyy, Stop War\" actually exists in Japan?",
        "Answer": "There is no credible evidence that a billboard saying \"Stop Zelenskyy, Stop War\" actually exists in Japan. Here are the reasons:\n\n1. **Altered Video Evidence**: The video claiming to show a billboard with this message was found to be altered. Investigations have shown that the original footage was shot in October 2020, and the banner seen in the video was not part of that footage, but rather digitally superimposed. The advertisement promoted has nothing to do with the Russia-Ukraine war, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the claim that such a billboard exists in Japan [Query1_evidence_1].\n\n2. **Documented Disinformation**: Various sources, including propaganda media and Telegram channels, propagated the claim that such a billboard was placed in Japan. However, these reports have been categorized as disinformation, aiming to undermine international support for Ukraine. The message on the alleged billboard appears to have been fabricated and does not reflect reality [Query1_evidence_2].\n\n3. **Official Position of Japan**: The Japanese government has made pro-Ukraine statements, further indicating that an anti-Ukrainian advertisement is unlikely to be sanctioned or placed on display in Japan. This context aligns with the lack of evidence supporting the billboard's existence [Query1_evidence_1].\n\nBased on the analysis of the evidence, I am confident in stating that there is no evidence supporting the existence of the billboard saying \"Stop Zelenskyy, Stop War\" in Japan, with a confidence level of 90%.",
