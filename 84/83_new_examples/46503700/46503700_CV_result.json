        "Question": "Is there evidence that the billboard saying \"Stop Zelenskyy, Stop War\" actually exists in Japan?",
        "Answer": "There is no credible evidence that a billboard saying \"Stop Zelenskyy, Stop War\" actually exists in Japan. Here are the reasons:\n\n1. **Altered Video Evidence**: The video claiming to show a billboard with this message was found to be altered. Investigations have shown that the original footage was shot in October 2020, and the banner seen in the video was not part of that footage, but rather digitally superimposed. The advertisement promoted has nothing to do with the Russia-Ukraine war, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the claim that such a billboard exists in Japan [Query1_evidence_1].\n\n2. **Documented Disinformation**: Various sources, including propaganda media and Telegram channels, propagated the claim that such a billboard was placed in Japan. However, these reports have been categorized as disinformation, aiming to undermine international support for Ukraine. The message on the alleged billboard appears to have been fabricated and does not reflect reality [Query1_evidence_2].\n\n3. **Official Position of Japan**: The Japanese government has made pro-Ukraine statements, further indicating that an anti-Ukrainian advertisement is unlikely to be sanctioned or placed on display in Japan. This context aligns with the lack of evidence supporting the billboard's existence [Query1_evidence_1].\n\nBased on the analysis of the evidence, I am confident in stating that there is no evidence supporting the existence of the billboard saying \"Stop Zelenskyy, Stop War\" in Japan, with a confidence level of 90%.",

        "Question": "What evidence exists to confirm the origin and authenticity of the video claiming to show the billboard?",
        "Answer": "The evidence regarding the origin and authenticity of the video claiming to show the billboard with the message \"Stop Zelenskyy, Stop War\" raises substantial doubts about its legitimacy. Here are the key points of evidence:\n\n1. **Alteration of Original Video**: The video that went viral was identified as having been altered. The original footage was filmed in October 2020, long before the current context of the Russia-Ukraine conflict was relevant. The message displayed on the billboard in the altered video was digitally superimposed. This manipulation indicates that the video does not authentically represent a real event occurring in Japan during the time claimed.\n\n2. **Context of Disinformation**: The claim regarding the billboard has been spread through various social media platforms, particularly among Georgian and Russian-speaking users, who have been identified as conduits for disseminating disinformation. This suggests that the intent behind sharing the video was potentially to undermine support for Ukraine, further casting doubt on the authenticity of the purported billboard.\n\n3. **Contradictory Cultural Context**: The Japanese government has publicly made pro-Ukraine statements, making it unlikely for an anti-Ukrainian advertisement to be displayed publicly in Japan. This official stance aligns with the absence of credible evidence supporting the existence of such a billboard, reinforcing skepticism about the video's authenticity.\n\nBased on the analysis of this evidence, I am confident in stating that there is no substantiated origin or authenticity to the video claiming to show the billboard.",

    "Follow_Up_Question_2": {
        "Question": "What sources can confirm the authenticity of the video and its claim about the billboard in Japan?",
        "Answer": "To address the question of what sources can confirm the authenticity of the video claiming to show a billboard in Japan stating \"Stop Zelenskyy, Stop War,\" several pieces of evidence suggest that the video is likely altered and misleading. 1. **Alteration Evidence**: The viral video is reported to be altered; while it depicts a bustling street in Tokyoâ€™s Shibuya district, the original footage was captured in October 2020, long before current events. Sources confirm that the message displayed on the billboard was digitally superimposed, disqualifying it as authentic representation of an actual event occurring in Japan [Query1_evidence_1]. 2. **Disinformation Context**: The claim around the billboard has been largely propagated by Russian propaganda and Telegram channels, which are known for disseminating false narratives. This desire to mislead indicates that the video and its claims do not serve as credible sources. The intention appears to be to weaken international support for Ukraine by misrepresenting the situation in Japan [Query1_evidence_2]. 3. **Japanese Government Stance**: The Japanese government has publicly supported Ukraine, which adds another layer of skepticism regarding the existence of an anti-Ukrainian billboard. The lack of any credible evidence or similar announcements reinforcing the authenticity of such an advertisement further implies that it is unlikely to have been displayed in Japan [Query1_evidence_1]. In summary, multiple credible sources suggest that the video in question is altered and does not authentically depict a billboard with the message \"Stop Zelenskyy, Stop War\" in Japan. Therefore, based on the analysis of these pieces of evidence, I can confidently state that there is no substantiated authenticity of the video or its claim, assigning a confidence level of 90%.",

    "CVResult": {
        "Judgment": "No",
        "Confidence": "90%",
        "Reason": "The existing information is sufficient to significantly doubt the truthfulness of the claim, but not overwhelmingly conclusive. Several points support this conclusion: 1. **Altered Video Evidence**: The video purportedly showing a billboard in Japan saying 'Stop Zelenskyy, Stop War' was found to be altered. The original footage was recorded in October 2020, long before the current international context with Ukraine began. Thus, the billboard message was digitally superimposed, indicating that this claim lacks authenticity [Query1_evidence_1]. 2. **Disinformation Context**: The claim surrounding the billboard has been disseminated through channels known for producing disinformation, particularly focusing on undermining international support for Ukraine. This context questions the legitimacy of the claim even further [Query1_evidence_2]. 3. **Official Japanese Stance**: The Japanese government has made pro-Ukraine statements, making the likelihood of an anti-Ukrainian advertisement being approved or displayed in Japan extremely low. This reinforces the skepticism about the existence of such a billboard [Query1_evidence_1]. While there is a high probability (90%) of the claim's falsehood based on the provided evidence, the definitive conclusion might require additional evidence or confirmation from independent verification sources. Therefore, the existing information is considered as insufficient to categorically assert a truthfulness judgment."

    "Final_Judgement": {
        "Answer": "False",
        "Reasons": "The claim that a billboard saying 'Stop Zelenskyy, Stop War' exists in Japan is false due to several key reasons: 1. The video showing the billboard was found to be altered; the original footage was filmed in October 2020, and the billboard message was digitally superimposed onto it. This manipulation indicates the video does not authentically represent an actual event in Japan [Follow_Up_Question_1_Query 1_evidence_1]. 2. The claim has been propagated through channels identified as sources of disinformation, particularly Russian and Georgian social media, aiming to undermine support for Ukraine [Follow_Up_Question_2_Query 1_evidence_2]. 3. The Japanese government has a pro-Ukraine stance, making it highly unlikely that such an anti-Ukrainian advertisement would be displayed without official sanction [Initial_Question_Generation_Query 1_evidence_1].",
