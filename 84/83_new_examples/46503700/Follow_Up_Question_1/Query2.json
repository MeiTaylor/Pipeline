It was shared on Facebook more than 50 times, according to CrowdTangle, a social media analytics tool.\n**Follow us on Facebook!**\nOur rating: Altered\n-------------------\nThe video was altered to include the anti-Zelenskyy billboard. The original video shows a different advertisement in its place, and it was posted online more than a year before Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nVideo edited to include anti-Zelenskyy display\n----------------------------------------------\nThe clip in the post was taken from a  uploaded to YouTube on Oct. 18, 2020, by a verified account called \"Virtual Japan,\" which posts  in Japan.\nIt shows the same buildings, vehicles and people as the clip in the post, but the digital billboard in question does not show a message critical of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Instead, it shows white Japanese writing on a pink background followed by images of people.\nAn image of the intersection in Shibuya City, Tokyo, taken in October 2022 can be seen on  . The billboard in that image does not show an anti-Zelenskyy billboard either.\n...[Content truncated]",

The photo shows a yellow taxi and several buildings, including the famous skyscraper, the Empire State Building. In addition, the street sign and the inscription Eighth Ave are visible in the photo.\n]\nAlthough the exact location of the billboard is not indicated in the post, the details marked in the photo allow us to find out, using geolocation tools, in which part of Manhattan the banner could have been placed.\nFirst, we look for the Empire State Building in Google Maps, which, according to the details indicated in the photo spread on the social network, was captured from Eighth Avenue. The view of the skyscraper from the streets on Eighth Avenue, as seen in the photo circulating on social media, should be possible from 33rd or 34th Street, according to the map.\n]\nThe Empire State Building is marked with a red rectangle Purple rectangle and line – Eighth Avenue With green arrows – 33rd and 34th Streets crossing Eighth Avenue. _Source:_ \nAs...[Content truncated]",

Why are wild theories about contrails and other phenomena so persistent on social media?**\nSuzanne Maher doesn't like the term \"conspiracy theory\".\nWhen I use it - on a phone call to arrange an interview - she tells me that it was invented by the CIA to discredit those who question the government.\nBut as the founder of Bye Bye Blue Sky - a group established to raise awareness of so-called \"chemtrails\" and what she claims is a massive, secret government conspiracy to control the weather - it's one the Canadian is used to hearing.\n\"I ask that we move beyond the notion that this is a conspiracy theory,\" she says. \"Twenty to thirty years ago we never saw these trails. We had a beautiful blue sky.\"\nMore on online conspiracy theories\n----------------------------------\n*   \n*   \nSuzanne is among a significant number of people using social media to spread this message.\n\"Chemtrail\" conspiracy theorists vary in their claims. But some of the most popular include the belief that governments control the weather on a massive scale, that scientists carrying out legitimate research about how to counteract climate change through a process called geo-engineering are secretly poisoning us, or even that secret powerful groups are spraying us with chemicals to make us pliant and easy to control.\nThe trails she's talking about are those you'll have seen yourself - plumes of white that form behind aircraft. They are simply water vapour released from aircraft engines that condenses into ice crystals if the atmospheric conditions are right. Suzanne Maher isn't correct when she says they're a new phenomenon: you can see condensation trails left behind aircraft in  during the Second World War.\nBut what most people call \"contrails\" Suzanne and other conspiracy theorists call \"chemtrails\" - and in them...[Content truncated]",

Fact-checkers detected a growth in the first half of February, even if the qualitative and quantitative levels of the disinformation was not alarmingly high.\nAfter the military actions against the whole Ukraine started in the morning of 24 February, though, fact-checkers witnessed the situation changing substantially and the disinformation about the events growing both in quantity and dangerousness.\n### Periodic Insights And Early Warnings: Disinformation  \nNarratives About The War In Ukraine\nEDMO publishes regular insights highlighting the main disinformation trends related to the war in Ukraine.
