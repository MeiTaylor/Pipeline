        "Question": "What evidence exists to confirm the origin and authenticity of the video claiming to show the billboard?",
        "Answer": "The evidence regarding the origin and authenticity of the video claiming to show the billboard with the message \"Stop Zelenskyy, Stop War\" raises substantial doubts about its legitimacy. Here are the key points of evidence:\n\n1. **Alteration of Original Video**: The video that went viral was identified as having been altered. The original footage was filmed in October 2020, long before the current context of the Russia-Ukraine conflict was relevant. The message displayed on the billboard in the altered video was digitally superimposed. This manipulation indicates that the video does not authentically represent a real event occurring in Japan during the time claimed.\n\n2. **Context of Disinformation**: The claim regarding the billboard has been spread through various social media platforms, particularly among Georgian and Russian-speaking users, who have been identified as conduits for disseminating disinformation. This suggests that the intent behind sharing the video was potentially to undermine support for Ukraine, further casting doubt on the authenticity of the purported billboard.\n\n3. **Contradictory Cultural Context**: The Japanese government has publicly made pro-Ukraine statements, making it unlikely for an anti-Ukrainian advertisement to be displayed publicly in Japan. This official stance aligns with the absence of credible evidence supporting the existence of such a billboard, reinforcing skepticism about the video's authenticity.\n\nBased on the analysis of this evidence, I am confident in stating that there is no substantiated origin or authenticity to the video claiming to show the billboard.",
