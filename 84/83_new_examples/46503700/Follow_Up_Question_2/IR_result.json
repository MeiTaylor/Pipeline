Prosecutors have sought to arrest Poroshenko on charges of treason and supporting terrorism, but a court in January  he could await trial while released on his own recognizance.

        "Question": "What sources can confirm the authenticity of the video and its claim about the billboard in Japan?",
        "Answer": "To address the question of what sources can confirm the authenticity of the video claiming to show a billboard in Japan stating \"Stop Zelenskyy, Stop War,\" several pieces of evidence suggest that the video is likely altered and misleading. 1. **Alteration Evidence**: The viral video is reported to be altered; while it depicts a bustling street in Tokyo’s Shibuya district, the original footage was captured in October 2020, long before current events. Sources confirm that the message displayed on the billboard was digitally superimposed, disqualifying it as authentic representation of an actual event occurring in Japan [Query1_evidence_1]. 2. **Disinformation Context**: The claim around the billboard has been largely propagated by Russian propaganda and Telegram channels, which are known for disseminating false narratives. This desire to mislead indicates that the video and its claims do not serve as credible sources. The intention appears to be to weaken international support for Ukraine by misrepresenting the situation in Japan [Query1_evidence_2]. 3. **Japanese Government Stance**: The Japanese government has publicly supported Ukraine, which adds another layer of skepticism regarding the existence of an anti-Ukrainian billboard. The lack of any credible evidence or similar announcements reinforcing the authenticity of such an advertisement further implies that it is unlikely to have been displayed in Japan [Query1_evidence_1]. In summary, multiple credible sources suggest that the video in question is altered and does not authentically depict a billboard with the message \"Stop Zelenskyy, Stop War\" in Japan. Therefore, based on the analysis of these pieces of evidence, I can confidently state that there is no substantiated authenticity of the video or its claim, assigning a confidence level of 90%.",
