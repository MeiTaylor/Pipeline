We are not mad about that, go ahead and run Ukraine if you want, if you think you can do a better job than Ukrainians. Just don\u2019t tell us it\u2019s a democracy.\u201d\nTo some extent, whether Ukraine is a democracy is a matter of opinion, so we will not offer a Pinocchio rating. But Carlson \u2014 who has  for Hungarian President Viktor Orb\u00e1n and his crackdown on civil liberties \u2014 is stacking the deck against Ukraine. It is a fledgling democracy, with significant growing pains, largely the result of Russian pressure and interference in its affairs. It is certainly not \u201ca tyranny.\u201d\n### The Facts\nUkraine has many aspects of a democracy. The president, who is head of state and commander in chief, is chosen by a popular election. The legislature has a mix of single-seat and proportional representation. The prime minister is chosen through a legislative majority and is head of government.

Ukraine\u2019s constitution, for instance, guarantees the right to peaceful assembly, but there is no law that specifically provides for freedom of assembly.\nThe country has struggled to build up a lasting democratic infrastructure as it has veered between leaders who lean toward Russia or toward the West. Corruption remains a serious problem that government officials have only halfheartedly addressed.\nZelensky has been engaged in a bitter political feud with the man he defeated in a landslide 2019 election, Petro Poroshenko. Prosecutors have sought to arrest Poroshenko on charges of treason and supporting terrorism, but a court in January  he could await trial while released on his own recognizance. Poroshenko had been accused of facilitating coal purchases for government enterprises from mines under the control of Moscow-backed insurgents in eastern Ukraine, helping finance the militants. He  the charges are politically motivated.\nFreedom House, a nonpartisan think tank that ranks democracies, has  Ukraine \u201ca transitional or hybrid regime\u201d in one recent report and \u201cpartly free\u201d in a .\nHungary, Carlson\u2019s fave, is  as...[Content truncated]",
