These creatures are commonly known as Antarctic feather stars.\nWhile they may share some traits with other invertebrates such as starfish and sea cucumbers, the feather stars distinguish themselves through their considerable size and a somewhat ethereal presence when in motion.\n“Although similar to other invertebrate ocean animals, like starfish and sea cucumbers, feather stars are distinct both in their ‘large’ size and ‘otherworldly appearance’ when swimming,” said the researchers.\nEight different species identified \n-----------------------------------\nThese marine anomalies have been found to inhabit depths ranging from 65 feet to an astounding 6,500 feet beneath the waves. The team identified eight singular species, half of which had never been previously described or named by the scientific...[Content truncated]",

Around 30 feet long, with four billowing arms and a domed head, the creature was larger than the tourists’ personal submersible.

Until that point, in January 2022, there had been only 126 recorded observations since the species was first described in 1910—including individuals caught in nets and footage captured by remotely operated underwater vehicles, or ROVs. Even scientists with the , which has logged thousands of hours of submersible dives, have seen just nine.\n!(blob:https://www.nationalgeographic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n0:17\nSurprisingly, the first  sighting was not a one-off.

Shipwrecks, herds of wild animals, even crimes in progress have been found on the site. But the newest find on Google Earth could top them all.\nSomeone claims to have found a huge sea creature near Antarctica.\nA now viral video on YouTube takes viewers there: Zoom in to Deception Island near Antarctica.

The unknown object is roughly 100 feet long, but that's only the portion seen above the water's surface.\n\"No idea what this is,\" wrote the owner of the video, YouTube user wowforreeel. \"When I saw it, it IMMEDIATELY made me think of a Plesiosaur fin.\"\nThe Plesiosaur is a prehistoric, extinct animal.\nMost theories are focusing on a mythical creature called a Kraken that is said to have terrorized the seas, grabbing entire ships and pulling them underwater without a trace.\nMany other people think it's nothing more than a huge rock.\nThe video was shared on YouTube on April 29 and recently took off, gaining more than 1.6 million views in only the last few days.\n**_Update: Reliable tools, such as actual paper maps, identify the \"mysterious sea creature\" as Sail Rock.

If true, this would be the first video of its kind.\n*   The team captured this footage by rigging a deep-sea camera to a polar tourism vessel.\n* * *\nHumans spend nearly their entire lives on land, but the Earth we call home is really a water world. With 71 percent of the Earth’s surface covered by water, this expansive  has been difficult to study, and many animals of the deep ocean remain a complete mystery.

Scientists only get a good look at these animals when trawlers accidentally catch them in their nets.

Yet, the  industry in Antarctica is growing rapidly, and collaboration between tourism companies and researchers provides important access to the region.”\nWhile leveraging tourism for marine exploration is a logistical win-win, finding verified footage of a colossal squid is as hard as ever.

There was the 50-foot decaying creature that washed up on an Indonesian island, so decomposed that people couldn’t identify what, exactly, they were taking selfies with.\nThere was the 300-toothed snake-headed shark that outlived its prehistoric contemporaries, providing 300 reasons to just say nope to the ocean. Last year, as The Washington Post’s Lindsey Bever reported, Hurricane Harvey deposited “a mysterious sea creature with fangs and no face” on a Texas beach. And then there was this bloated monstrosity, snapped by a pair of fishermen who probably still wake up in the middle of the night screaming.\nFor those who still believe that most things in the ocean are cute, if not cuddly, there is Enypniastes eximia, an ocean-bottom-dwelling sea cucumber that does a close approximation of swimming in the Southern Ocean off eastern Antarctica, according to the Australian Antarctic Division. A recent sighting by Australian scientists marked the first time this particular sea creature has been seen in the Southern Ocean.\nIf Enypniastes eximia is too much of a mouthful, the creeped-out masses have given the sea cucumber another, more fitting name: “the headless chicken monster.”\nThat’s because this sea cucumber, as captured by deep-sea cameras, looks like what would happen if an oven-ready chicken dinner decided to make a sudden dash for freedom.\n(Full disclosure: E. eximia has also been dubbed “the Spanish Dancer” by well-intentioned taxonomists with apparently little knowledge of Spain or dancing.)\nThe sea cucumber in question feasts on organic material in the sediment of the ocean floor, “walking” along the bottom and using its tentacles to grab food. Because the animal is mostly transparent, it’s possible to see the food working its way through its intestines.\nAn 11-million-ton iceberg is threatening a tiny village in Greenland\nResearchers captured the footage with a specially built camera attached to lines used to capture deep-sea fish in dark regions nearly two miles beneath the surface of the ocean.\n“We needed something that could be thrown from the side of a boat and would continue operating reliably under extreme pressure in the pitch black for long periods of time,” said Australian Antarctic Division Program leader Dirk Welsford. “Some of the footage we...[Content truncated]",
