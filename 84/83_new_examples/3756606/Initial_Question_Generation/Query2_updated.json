Some strandings can serve as indicators of ocean health, giving insight into larger environmental issues that may also have implications for human health and welfare.\n#### Marine Mammal Unusual Mortality Events\nBlue whales have been part of a declared unusual mortality event . Under the , an unusual mortality event is defined as \"a stranding that is unexpected; involves a significant die-off of any marine mammal population; and demands immediate response.\" To understand the health of marine mammal populations, scientists study unusual mortality events.\n#### Reducing Ocean Noise\nNoise pollution can threaten whale populations, interrupting their normal behavior and driving them away from areas important to their survival. NOAA Fisheries is investigating all aspects of acoustic communication and hearing in marine animals, as well as the effects of sound on whale behavior and hearing. In 2018, NOAA Fisheries  for assessing the effects of anthropogenic sound on marine mammals\u2019 hearing.\n* * *\n### Regulatory History\nThe blue whale is listed as endangered throughout its range under the ESA and is thus considered depleted throughout its range under the MMPA.\nInternationally, blue whales received complete legal protection from commercial whaling in 1966 under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling.\nKey Actions and Documents\n-------------------------\nEffective\nNovember 9, 2020\n#### \nBy notice of proposed rulemaking published in the Federal Register on July 30, 1970 (35FR12222), notice was given that it was proposed to amend Appendix A to Part 17 of Title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations by adding additional names to the list\u2026\n*   \nEffective\nDecember 2, 1970\nLast updated by NOAA Fisheries on 09/28/2023\nScience Overview\n----------------\nNOAA Fisheries conducts various research activities on the biology, behavior, and ecology of blue whales. The results of this research are used to inform management decisions and enhance recovery efforts for this endangered species.\n#### **Environmental Modeling**\nScientists working on the  project are using advanced technologies to predict where blue whales are likely to be in near real-time off the U.S. West Coast. This near real-time information helps reduce human effects on whales by providing information on where the whales occur and hence where whales may be most at risk from threats such as vessel strikes, entanglements, and underwater noise. Scientists developed habitat-based model estimates of whale occurrence that combine satellite tracking of whales with information on the environment.\n#### **Stock Assessments**\nDetermining the size of the blue whale population\u2014and whether it is increasing or decreasing\u2014helps resource managers assess the success of the conservation measures enacted.

Later, bizarre and alien-like creatures reigned supreme. Even creatures more familiar to us, like sharks, whales, and octopuses have long and storied pasts with ancestors very different than the creatures now roaming the seas. Some species existed for a geological moment before they went extinct, while others slowly adapted to changing seas. Evolution takes time, and when the ocean changed too rapidly for species to respond, mass extinctions occurred across the globe.

However, these are only the most visible members of a thriving Antarctic ecosystem, much of which remains largely unseen.\nUnder the water and beneath the ice, a vibrant community of animals found only in Antarctica thrives in cold, oxygen-rich waters. From glass sponges and colossal squid to notothenioidei (a group of fish with antifreeze proteins in their blood) and enormous sea spiders the size of dinner plates, Antarctica and the Southern Ocean support an incredible diversity of unique life, each species  to the conditions of the South.\nANTARCTIC HABITATS\n##### Ocean\nAlmost all Antarctic life begins and ends in the Southern Ocean. To understand Antarctica, its ecosystems and its largest, most well-loved inhabitants, we need to look to the sea.\n!\n!\nSea ice algae on ice\n#### Ocean\n#### ANTARCTIC HABITATS\nThe Southern Ocean is one of the most biologically rich places on our planet. A rare combination of long summer days, swirling ocean currents and cold water rich in oxygen and nutrients gives rise to an abundance of life rarely seen on earth. The sheer biomass of Antarctic species eclipses most other species on the planet.\nLife in the Southern Ocean begins with microscopic plants called phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are primary producers, which means they produce their own energy from light and chemicals. Like plants on land, they generate energy through photosynthesis, drawing on the sun\u2019s light and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to grow.\nWhen conditions are just right, primary producers proliferate in huge numbers. There are billions of these single-celled plants, many of them types of algae, in the Southern Ocean. Some algal blooms are so large they can be seen from space. These \u2018marine forests\u2019 form the foundation of the Antarctic food web, providing food for zooplankton.\n!\nAntarctic krill (_Euphausia superba_)\n#### Ocean\n#### ANTARCTIC HABITATS\nZooplankton are small, grazing animals such as pteropods, copep...[Content truncated]",

It forms in both the Arctic and the Antarctic in each hemisphere\u2019s winter; it retreats in the summer, but does not completely disappear. This floating ice has a profound influence on the polar environment, influencing ocean circulation, weather, and regional climate.\n!\nSea ice plays an important role in the climate and ecosystems of the Arctic and Antarctic. (Photograph \u00a92008 .)\nAs ice crystals form at the ocean surface, they expel salt, which increases the salinity of the underlying waters. This cold, salty water is dense and can sink to the ocean floor, where it flows back toward the equator. The sea ice layer also restricts wind and wave action near coastlines, lessening coastal erosion and protecting ice shelves. Sea ice also creates an insulating cap across the ocean surface, which reduces evaporation and heat loss to the atmosphere. As a result, the weather over ice-covered areas tends to be colder and drier than it would be without ice.\nSea ice also plays a fundamental role in polar ecosystems. When the ice melts in the summer, it releases nutrients into the water, stimulating the growth of phytoplankton, the center of the marine food web. As the ice melts, it exposes ocean water to sunlight, spurring photosynthesis in phytoplankton. When ice freezes, the underlying water gets saltier and...[Content truncated]",

This\u00a0diatom species,\u00a0Fragilariopsis kerguelensis, photographed both alive (left) and fossilized (right), is a floating algae that is abundant in the Antarctic Ocean and was the major species in the samples collected for this study. Nitrogen isotopes in their shells vary with the amount of unused nitrogen in the surface water. Researchers used that to trace nitrogen concentrations in Antarctic surface waters over the past 150,000 years, covering two ice ages and two warm interglacial periods.\nThe last million years of Earth history have been characterized by frequent \u201cglacial-interglacial cycles,\u201d large swings in climate that are linked to the growing and shrinking of massive, continent-spanning ice sheets. These cycles are triggered by subtle oscillations in Earth\u2019s orbit and rotation, but the orbital oscillations are too subtle to explain the large changes in climate. \n\u201cThe cause of the ice ages is one of the great unsolved problems in the geosciences,\u201d said Daniel Sigman, the Dusenbury Professor of Geological and Geophysical Sciences. \u201cExplaining this dominant climate phenomenon will improve our ability to predict future climate change.\u201d\nIn the 1970s, scientists discovered that the concentration of the atmospheric greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) was about 30% lower during the ice ages. That prompted theories that the decrease in atmospheric CO2 levels is a key ingredient in the glacial cycles, but the causes of the CO2 change remained unknown. Some data suggested that, during ice ages, CO2 was trapped in the deep ocean, but the reason for this was debated.\nNow, an international collaboration led by scientists from Princeton University and the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry (MPIC) have found evidence indicating that during ice ages, changes in the surface waters of the Antarctic Ocean worked to store more CO2 in the deep ocean....[Content truncated]",
