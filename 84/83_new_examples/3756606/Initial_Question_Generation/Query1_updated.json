The unknown object is\u00a0roughly\u00a0100 feet long, but that's only the\u00a0portion seen above the water's surface.\n\"No idea what this is,\" wrote the owner of the video, YouTube user wowforreeel. \"When I saw it, it IMMEDIATELY made me think of a Plesiosaur fin.\"\nThe Plesiosaur is a prehistoric, extinct animal.\nMost theories are focusing on a mythical creature called a Kraken that is said to have terrorized the seas, grabbing entire ships and pulling them underwater without a trace.\nMany other people think it's nothing more than a huge rock.\nThe video was shared on\u00a0YouTube on April 29 and recently took off, gaining more than 1.6 million views in only the last few days.\n**_Update: Reliable tools, such as actual paper maps, identify the \"mysterious sea creature\" as Sail Rock.

With 71 percent of the Earth\u2019s surface covered by water, this expansive  has been difficult to study, and many animals of the deep ocean remain a complete mystery. One of the most spellbinding of these animals is the colossal squid (_Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni_).

Yet, the  industry in Antarctica is growing rapidly, and collaboration between tourism companies and researchers provides important access to the region.\u201d\nWhile leveraging tourism for marine exploration is a logistical win-win, finding verified footage of a colossal squid is as hard as ever.

There was the 50-foot decaying creature that washed up on an Indonesian island, so decomposed that people couldn\u2019t identify what, exactly, they were taking selfies with.\nThere was the 300-toothed snake-headed shark that outlived its prehistoric contemporaries, providing 300 reasons to just say nope to the ocean. Last year, as The Washington Post\u2019s Lindsey Bever reported, Hurricane Harvey deposited \u201ca mysterious sea creature with fangs and no face\u201d on a Texas beach. And then there was this bloated monstrosity, snapped by a pair of fishermen who probably still wake up in the middle of the night screaming.\nFor those who still believe that most things in the ocean are cute, if not cuddly, there is Enypniastes eximia, an ocean-bottom-dwelling sea cucumber that does a close approximation of swimming in the Southern Ocean off eastern Antarctica, according to the Australian Antarctic Division. A recent sighting by Australian scientists marked the first time this particular sea creature has been seen in the Southern Ocean.\nIf Enypniastes eximia is too much of a mouthful, the creeped-out masses have given the sea cucumber another, more fitting name: \u201cthe headless chicken monster.\u201d\nThat\u2019s because this sea cucumber, as captured by deep-sea cameras, looks like what would happen if an oven-ready chicken dinner decided to make a sudden dash for freedom.\n(Full disclosure: E. eximia has also been dubbed \u201cthe Spanish Dancer\u201d by well-intentioned taxonomists with apparently little knowledge of Spain or dancing.)\nThe sea cucumber in question feasts on organic material in the sediment of the ocean floor, \u201cwalking\u201d along the bottom and using its tentacles to grab food. Because the animal is mostly transparent, it\u2019s possible to see the food working its way through its intestines.\nAn 11-million-ton iceberg is threatening a tiny village in Greenland\nResearchers captured the footage with a specially built camera attached to lines used to capture deep-sea fish in dark regions nearly two miles beneath the surface of the ocean.\n\u201cWe needed something that could be thrown from the side of a boat and would continue operating reliably under extreme pressure in the pitch black for long periods of time,\u201d said Australian Antarctic Division Program leader Dirk Welsford. \u201cSome of the footage we...[Content truncated]",
