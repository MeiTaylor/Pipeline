However, these are only the most visible members of a thriving Antarctic ecosystem, much of which remains largely unseen.\nUnder the water and beneath the ice, a vibrant community of animals found only in Antarctica thrives in cold, oxygen-rich waters. From glass sponges and colossal squid to notothenioidei (a group of fish with antifreeze proteins in their blood) and enormous sea spiders the size of dinner plates, Antarctica and the Southern Ocean support an incredible diversity of unique life, each species  to the conditions of the South.\nANTARCTIC HABITATS\n##### Ocean\nAlmost all Antarctic life begins and ends in the Southern Ocean. To understand Antarctica, its ecosystems and its largest, most well-loved inhabitants, we need to look to the sea.\n!\n!\nSea ice algae on ice\n#### Ocean\n#### ANTARCTIC HABITATS\nThe Southern Ocean is one of the most biologically rich places on our planet. A rare combination of long summer days, swirling ocean currents and cold water rich in oxygen and nutrients gives rise to an abundance of life rarely seen on earth. The sheer biomass of Antarctic species eclipses most other species on the planet.\nLife in the Southern Ocean begins with microscopic plants called phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are primary producers, which means they produce their own energy from light and chemicals. Like plants on land, they generate energy through photosynthesis, drawing on the sun’s light and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to grow.\nWhen conditions are just right, primary producers proliferate in huge numbers. There are billions of these single-celled plants, many of them types of algae, in the Southern Ocean. Some algal blooms are so large they can be seen from space. These ‘marine forests’ form the foundation of the Antarctic food web, providing food for zooplankton.\n!\nAntarctic krill (_Euphausia superba_)\n#### Ocean\n#### ANTARCTIC HABITATS\nZooplankton are small, grazing animals such as pteropods, copep...[Content truncated]",

But now, scientists have , an ancient aquatic reptile that swam the seas of the  alongside the dinosaurs. The animal would have weighed as much as 15 tons, and it is now one of the most complete ancient reptile fossils ever discovered in Antarctica.\nElasmosaurs make up a family of the plesiosaurs, which represent some of the largest sea creatures of the Cretaceous. Plesiosaurs generally look a little like large manatees with giraffe necks and snake-like heads, though they have four flippers rather than a manatee’s three.

Around 30 feet long, with four billowing arms and a domed head, the creature was larger than the tourists’ personal submersible. This startling sight occurred hundreds of feet underwater off the coast of ’s Rongé Island.\nWhen they returned to their  cruise ship and showed photos to , a marine biologist with Exeter University in the U.K., he knew they’d seen “something incredibly rare.”\nAs it turns out, these lucky travelers are among only a handful of people ever to lay eyes on the giant phantom jellyfish, or _Stygiomedusa gigantea_. Until that point, in January 2022, there had been only 126 recorded observations since the species was first described in 1910—including individuals caught in nets and footage captured by remotely operated underwater vehicles, or ROVs. Even scientists with the , which has logged thousands of hours of submersible dives, have seen just nine.\n!(blob:https://www.nationalgeographic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n0:17\nSurprisingly, the first  sighting was not a one-off.

        "Question": "What evidence supports the claim of a giant sea monster sighting near Antarctica?",
        "Answer": "The claim of a giant sea monster sighting near Antarctica can be supported by several pieces of evidence, primarily relating to sightings of large, elusive marine creatures in that region.\n\n1. **Sightings of Colossal Squid**: Interestingly, scientists have recently claimed to have spotted a juvenile colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni) during a deep-sea expedition around Antarctica. This creature is known to be one of the largest invertebrates in the world, possibly growing as long as a bus and weighing nearly 1,100 pounds. Although this sighting is not confirmed, it represents a significant event in marine biology, as the colossal squid had not been seen alive in its natural habitat before this claimed sighting. The research team used a specially outfitted polar tourism vessel to capture footage during their expeditions, which adds a layer of credibility to the sighting.\n\n2. **Presence of Ancient Marine Monsters**: Fossil discoveries in Antarctica also suggest that the region was home to enormous marine reptiles, such as elasmosaurs, which could weigh up to 15 tons. This historical context indicates that giant marine creatures have existed in Antarctic waters, supporting the idea that large marine animals could still be present or rediscovered in modern times.\n\n3. **Recent Rare Sightings of Large Jellyfish**: In February 2023, tourists captured footage of a 30-foot-long phantom jellyfish off the coast of Antarctica, which is an extremely rare sighting. Given that only about 130 sightings of this mysterious deep-sea creature have been recorded since its description in 1910, this occurrence highlights the existence of significant, large marine organisms that many would consider monstrous compared to typical sea life.\n\nThese pieces of evidence suggest that while the claim of a giant sea monster remains anecdotal and subject to interpretation, there are legitimate grounds to consider the possibility of large, unknown marine creatures in Antarctic waters, thus supporting the notion of a \"giant sea monster.\"",
