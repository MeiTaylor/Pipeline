University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa scientists traveled to the remote continent and saw first-hand the behaviors of these mysterious creatures, and their findings could have wider implications for marine life and ocean ecosystems in Antarctica and around the world.\n!\nGiant Antarctic sea spider (Photo credit: R. Robbins)\nSea spiders, or pycnogonids, are a group of spider-like invertebrates found in marine habitats globally. Most species are smaller than a fingernail, but some Antarctic species have leg spans (tip of one leg to the tip of the opposite leg) of more than a foot. These animals are a famous example of “polar gigantism,” a phenomenon where certain organisms in polar regions, such as the Arctic and Antarctic, grow to much larger sizes than their relatives in warmer climates.\n“In most sea spiders, the male parent takes care of the babies by carrying them around while they develop,” UH Mānoa  Professor and lead researcher Amy Moran said. “What’s weird is that despite descriptions and research going back over 140 years, no one had ever seen the giant Antarctic sea spiders brooding their young or knew anything about their development.”\n!\nMoran on a research dive, picking up a large sea spider (Photo credit: R. Robbins)\nMoran’s lab has studied polar gigantism for more than a decade. In October 2021, during a field research expedition to Antarctica, the team, including Moran and School of Life Sciences PhD students Aaron Toh and Graham Lobert, made...[Content truncated]",

Around 30 feet long, with four billowing arms and a domed head, the creature was larger than the tourists’ personal submersible. This startling sight occurred hundreds of feet underwater off the coast of ’s Rongé Island.\nWhen they returned to their  cruise ship and showed photos to , a marine biologist with Exeter University in the U.K., he knew they’d seen “something incredibly rare.”\nAs it turns out, these lucky travelers are among only a handful of people ever to lay eyes on the giant phantom jellyfish, or _Stygiomedusa gigantea_. Until that point, in January 2022, there had been only 126 recorded observations since the species was first described in 1910—including individuals caught in nets and footage captured by remotely operated underwater vehicles, or ROVs. Even scientists with the , which has logged thousands of hours of submersible dives, have seen just nine.\n!(blob:https://www.nationalgeographic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\n0:17\nSurprisingly, the first  sighting was not a one-off.

With its outstretched vermillion tentacles, see-through body and faint blue bioluminescent glow, this five-inch-long squid is, potentially, the first  ever filmed in its natural environment.\n!\nVideo captured off Antarctica roughly 650 feet deep below the surface shows what might be a juvenile colossal squid living freely in its natural environment. It’s possible this is not a colossal squid but instead another kind of closely related glass squid. Video courtesy of Matthew Mulrennan / Kolossal\nMulrennan, a marine scientist and founder of the California-based nonprofit Kolossal, has been working since 2017 to record footage of wild colossal squid (_Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni_). Cephalopod experts are convinced Mulrennan filmed some sort of glass squid, the scientific family to which colossal squid belong. But they remain unsure whether it was a young colossal, an adult  or a previously unknown species in the closely related genus _Taonius_.\nThe Antarctic water where Mulrennan’s team spotted the squid was full of marine snow, giving the video a grainy quality reminiscent of the first photos of another little-known cephalopod: the .\nAlthough both cephalopods are so elusive they’re practically legendary—and often compared to the mythical kraken—colossal squid have bigger, heavier bodies and slightly shorter tentacles than their giant brethren. While giant squid were first  and  in their natural habitat in 2004 and 2012, respectively, the only sightings of colossal squid have come from corpses or animals dragged up to the surface.\nUntil, perhaps, now.\n* * *\nColossal squid were first scientifically described by zoologist Guy Robson  after a  washed up in the Falkland Islands with two colossal squid tentacles in its stomach. Since then, the massive animals have rarely been caught, photographed or even seen. That’s a striking feat for a creature longer than a cargo container with eyes the size of volleyballs. As adults, colossal squid are Earth’s largest invertebrates. They eat  (also known as ) and are hunted by sperm whales. When they’re young, colossal squid seem to venture closer to the ocean’s surface, where they’re picked off by penguins, albatrosses, seals and Patagonian toothfish.

        "Question": "What additional footage or imagery exists to corroborate the giant creature's size and identity in the video?",
        "Answer": "To address the question of what additional footage or imagery exists to corroborate the giant creature's size and identity in the video, we can draw from several notable sightings and research that relate to large marine species in Antarctic waters:\n\n1. **Colossal Squid Footage**: A significant piece of evidence comes from footage that was captured by marine scientist Matthew Mulrennan on January 6, 2023, in the Southern Ocean. This footage shows what is potentially a juvenile colossal squid (_Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni_) living freely at a depth of approximately 575 feet. This sighting may provide strong evidence regarding the size and identity of large marine creatures in that region, as the colossal squid is one of the largest invertebrates known to exist, capable of reaching remarkable sizes [Query1_evidence_1].\n\n2. **Phantom Jellyfish Sighting**: In February 2023, tourists recorded a sighting of a 30-foot-long phantom jellyfish (_Stygiomedusa gigantea_) off the coast of Antarctica. This jellyfish is extremely rare, with fewer than 130 recorded sightings. Such large and unique organisms might be misidentified as 'sea monsters,' emphasizing the potential for significant marine life in these waters that could explain the claim of a giant sea creature [Query1_evidence_2].\n\nOverall, these examples enhance the context of sightings related to large marine animals, indicating that while the claim of a giant sea monster may remain unverifiable, there are indeed credible instances of sizable unidentified marine life in Antarctic waters that could support such myths or claims.",
