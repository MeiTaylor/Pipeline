Thermal vents under Antarctica have yielded \"lost worlds\" of new animals; , as well, have led us to exciting new classifications. And deserts, what seem to be the most inhabitable of all climates, have also given us new creatures to study, including ant-like bees and the . But almost everyone agrees that if there is a large animal out there we've never seen before, it's bound to be in that most mysterious biome of all: the ocean.\nThe ocean is as mysterious a place to us as space. Fathoms deep, teeming with life and hard to explore, the ocean has yet to give up all its secrets; scientists estimate that two-thirds of marine life has yet to be discovered. And with the rates of extinction, many species are winking out before we have a chance to study them.  to hear Matt's, Ben's and Noel's thoughts on whether we'll ever know exactly what we're sharing this world with.\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n##### What are some potential habitats where large undiscovered animals could exist?\nLarge, undiscovered animals could potentially exist in remote and inaccessible habitats such as deep ocean trenches, dense rainforests, unexplored caves or rugged mountainous regions, where they may have evolved to remain elusive to human detection.\n##### Are there any cultural or Indigenous beliefs that suggest the existence of large undiscovered animals?\nYes, there is no shortage of folklore, legends and myths about large undiscovered animals, known as cryptids, which continue to fuel interest and speculation in the field of cryptozoology.",

For decades, they had all but disappeared from previously highly frequented feeding grounds in Antarctic waters. Our dedicated surveys now confirm their return to ancestral feeding grounds, gathering at the Antarctic Peninsula in large aggregations to feed. We report on the results of an abundance survey and present the first scientific documentation of large fin whale feeding aggregations at Elephant Island, Antarctica, including the first ever video documentation. We interpret high densities, re-establishment of historical behaviours and the return to ancestral feeding grounds as signs for a recovering population. Recovery of a large whale population has the potential to augment primary productivity at their feeding grounds through the effects of nutrient recycling, known as 'the whale pump'. The recovery of fin whales in that area could thus restore ecosystem functions crucial for atmospheric carbon regulation in the world's most important ocean region for the uptake of anthropogenic CO2.\nFin whales (Balaenoptera physalus quoyi) of the Southern Hemisphere were brought to near extinction by twentieth century industrial whaling1. More than 700,000 individuals were killed2 between 1904, when intensive commercial whaling began in the Southern Ocean, and 1976, when the catch quota of fin whales was set to zero, 10 years before the moratorium on whaling3,4. It has been estimated that by then the population had been reduced to 1–2% of its pre-exploitation size of around 325,000 animals in the early twentieth century2,5,6. Major whaling for fin whales took place at their feeding grounds at the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula7. After the end of commercial whaling, cetacean surveys conducted under the auspices of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) between 1978 and 2004 (IDCR/SOWER surveys), reported very few fin whales in that region8. They had seemingly vanished from those historical feeding grounds. About 40 years later, our surveys now confirm a return of the whales to their ancestral feeding grounds in high numbers, forming large feeding aggregations.\nIn the post-whaling era, the International Whaling Commission’s (IWC) International Decade of Cetacean Research (IDCR) and Southern Ocean Whale Ecosystem Research (SOWER) cruise programmes, carried out in three circumpolar sets of surveys between 1978 and 2004, provided the only comprehensive information on fin whale abundance in the Southern Hemisphere. Based on IDCR/SOWER data from surveys between 1991 and 1998, circump...[Content truncated]",

These creatures are commonly known as Antarctic feather stars.\nWhile they may share some traits with other invertebrates such as starfish and sea cucumbers, the feather stars distinguish themselves through their considerable size and a somewhat ethereal presence when in motion.\n“Although similar to other invertebrate ocean animals, like starfish and sea cucumbers, feather stars are distinct both in their ‘large’ size and ‘otherworldly appearance’ when swimming,” said the researchers.\nEight different species identified \n-----------------------------------\nThese marine anomalies have been found to inhabit depths ranging from 65 feet to an astounding 6,500 feet beneath the waves.

The animals deeper down don't have the food sources that travel along currents (krill, plankton, large schools of fish) so They don't have access to the large scale food sources that underwater behemoths need (as far as we know). There are still large animals down there though. Goblin sharks which get up to four meters if I remember correctly, six and seven gill sharks that are considered to be living fossils and can be around 16 feet long. The previously mentioned colossal squid and giant squid which can be over 30 feet if memory serves, the oarfish which can be over 20 feet. Giant octopods which also reach past 20 feet. Some extremely long deep sea jellies. The gulper eel is only about two meters long but looks pretty terrifying. There are large clams and starfish as well. Finally one of the most resilient species down there are the chimeras and eat fish (might be the same animal now). Anyways, I'm no scientist but I thought you might be interested in that.

With its outstretched vermillion tentacles, see-through body and faint blue bioluminescent glow, this five-inch-long squid is, potentially, the first  ever filmed in its natural environment.\n!\nVideo captured off Antarctica roughly 650 feet deep below the surface shows what might be a juvenile colossal squid living freely in its natural environment. It’s possible this is not a colossal squid but instead another kind of closely related glass squid. Video courtesy of Matthew Mulrennan / Kolossal\nMulrennan, a marine scientist and founder of the California-based nonprofit Kolossal, has been working since 2017 to record footage of wild colossal squid (_Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni_). Cephalopod experts are convinced Mulrennan filmed some sort of glass squid, the scientific family to which colossal squid belong. But they remain unsure whether it was a young colossal, an adult  or a previously unknown species in the closely related genus _Taonius_.\nThe Antarctic water where Mulrennan’s team spotted the squid was full of marine snow, giving the video a grainy quality reminiscent of the first photos of another little-known cephalopod: the .\nAlthough both cephalopods are so elusive they’re practically legendary—and often compared to the mythical kraken—colossal squid have bigger, heavier bodies and slightly shorter tentacles than their giant brethren. While giant squid were first  and  in their natural habitat in 2004 and 2012, respectively, the only sightings of colossal squid have come from corpses or animals dragged up to the surface.\nUntil, perhaps, now.\n* * *\nColossal squid were first scientifically described by zoologist Guy Robson  after a  washed up in the Falkland Islands with two colossal squid tentacles in its stomach. Since then, the massive animals have rarely been caught, photographed or even seen. That’s a striking feat for a creature longer than a cargo container with eyes the size of volleyballs. As adults, colossal squid are Earth’s largest invertebrates. They eat  (also known as ) and are hunted by sperm whales. When they’re young, colossal squid seem to venture closer to the ocean’s surface, where they’re picked off by penguins, albatrosses, seals and Patagonian toothfish.
