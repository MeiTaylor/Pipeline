University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa scientists traveled to the remote continent and saw first-hand the behaviors of these mysterious creatures, and their findings could have wider implications for marine life and ocean ecosystems in Antarctica and around the world.\n!\nGiant Antarctic sea spider (Photo credit: R. Robbins)\nSea spiders, or pycnogonids, are a group of spider-like invertebrates found in marine habitats globally. Most species are smaller than a fingernail, but some Antarctic species have leg spans (tip of one leg to the tip of the opposite leg) of more than a foot. These animals are a famous example of \u201cpolar gigantism,\u201d a phenomenon where certain organisms in polar regions, such as the Arctic and Antarctic, grow to much larger sizes than their relatives in warmer climates.\n\u201cIn most sea spiders, the male parent takes care of the babies by carrying them around while they develop,\u201d UH M\u0101noa  Professor and lead researcher Amy Moran said. \u201cWhat\u2019s weird is that despite descriptions and research going back over 140 years, no one had ever seen the giant Antarctic sea spiders brooding their young or knew anything about their development.\u201d\n!\nMoran on a research dive, picking up a large sea spider (Photo credit: R. Robbins)\nMoran\u2019s lab has studied polar gigantism for more than a decade.

Shown here: a .\nListen to the Bloop\n-------------------\nIn 1997, researchers listening for underwater volcanic activity in the southern Pacific recorded a strange, powerful, and extremely loud sound. Using , or underwater microphones, that were placed more than 3,219 kilometers apart across the Pacific, they recorded numerous instances of the noise, which was unlike anything they had heard before. Not only was it loud, the sound had a unique characteristic that came to be known as \u201cthe Bloop.\u201d\nScientists from NOAA\u2019s  were eager to discover the sound's origin, but with  theories abounded. Was the Bloop from secret underwater military exercises, ship engines, fishing boat winches, giant squids, whales, or a some sea creature unknown to science?\nAs the years passed, PMEL researchers continued to deploy hydrophones ever closer to Antarctica in an ongoing effort to study the sounds of sea floor volcanoes and earthquakes. It was there, on Earth\u2019s lonely southernmost land mass, that they finally discovered the source of those thunderous rumbles from the deep in 2005.

With its outstretched vermillion tentacles, see-through body and faint blue bioluminescent glow, this five-inch-long squid is, potentially, the first\u00a0\u00a0ever filmed in its natural environment.\n!\nVideo captured off Antarctica roughly 650 feet deep below the surface shows what might be a juvenile colossal squid living freely in its natural environment. It\u2019s possible this is not a colossal squid but instead another kind of closely related glass squid. Video courtesy of Matthew Mulrennan / Kolossal\nMulrennan, a marine scientist and founder of the California-based nonprofit Kolossal, has been working since 2017 to record footage of wild colossal squid (_Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni_). Cephalopod experts are convinced Mulrennan filmed some sort of glass squid, the scientific family to which colossal squid belong. But they remain unsure whether it was a young colossal, an adult \u00a0or a previously unknown species in the closely related genus _Taonius_.\nThe Antarctic water where Mulrennan\u2019s team spotted the squid was full of marine snow, giving the video a grainy quality reminiscent of the first photos of another little-known cephalopod: the .\nAlthough both cephalopods are so elusive they\u2019re practically legendary\u2014and often compared to the mythical kraken\u2014colossal squid have bigger, heavier bodies and slightly shorter tentacles than their giant brethren. While giant squid were first  and  in their natural habitat in 2004 and 2012, respectively, the only sightings of colossal squid have come from corpses or animals dragged up to the surface.\nUntil, perhaps, now.\n* * *\nColossal squid were first scientifically described by zoologist Guy Robson  after a  washed up in the Falkland Islands with two colossal squid tentacles in its stomach. Since then, the massive animals have rarely been caught, photographed or even seen. That\u2019s a striking feat for a creature longer than a cargo container with eyes the size of volleyballs. As adults, colossal squid are Earth\u2019s largest invertebrates. They eat  (also known as ) and are hunted by sperm whales. When they\u2019re young, colossal squid seem to venture closer to the ocean\u2019s surface, where they\u2019re picked off by penguins, albatrosses, seals and Patagonian toothfish.

The Antarctic Peninsula, which accounts for about 5% of the Antarctic continent, is possibly the fastest changing place on earth. The temperature has gone up by three degrees in 50 years. Most of Antarctica isn't changing, but on the peninsula we are seeing glaciers receding, ice shelves collapsing, plants growing where they never grew before, and the general ecology is changing. Fifty years is just a blink of an eye in geological time.\nChris - And is man causing this?\nLloyd - I think a lot of it is down to man. You can't discount some contribution from natural cycles and natural effects, but you just can't get away from the fact that man is changing the environment on earth.\nChris - Why is Antarctica such a special place?\n\n\n\nLloyd - Antarctica is different...[Content truncated]",
