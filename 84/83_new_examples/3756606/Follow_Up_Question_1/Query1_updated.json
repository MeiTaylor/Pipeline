Miles beneath the surface, where sunlight can no longer penetrate, exists an eerie world of cold darkness. This is the abyss. It is a world of strange and sometimes grotesque forms. Some of the animals here have evolved the ability to create their own light with a technique known as bioluminescence. They use their lights to attract prey and ward off predators. There are also creatures here of gigantic proportions. There are also animals here that get all of their nutrients from chemicals in the ocean through a process known as chemosynthesis. This is where the elusive giant squid hunts. It is also where the great sperm whale comes to feed on the giant squid. Here, within the waters of our own planet, lies an alien world of wonders.\nOver the centuries, the oceans have given birth to many myths, legends, mysteries and events still not completely explained by mankind.

Miles from shore on storm-tossed seas, with nothing but water in all directions--including straight down--a sailor or fisherman cannot help but wonder what lurks in the depths. When the oceans were still unexplored, these fears often took the form of imaginary monsters.\nMany sea monsters include features from living animals. A large tentacle becomes part of a monstrous sea serpent or many-armed kraken: The eye sees a fragment, the mind fills in the rest. A blend of tall tales, mistaken identity, and resonant cultural symbols, stories of sea monsters often reveal more about the minds of the imaginers than they do about the natural world.\n\"It was a giant squid twenty-five feet long. It was heading toward the Nautilus, swimming backward very fast.... We could clearly make out the 250 suckers lining the inside of its tentacles, some of which fastened onto the glass panel of the lounge.

And roughly 2,000 blue whales \u2013 perhaps a sixth of the global population \u2013 generally feed here. But in 2005 and 2006, all that changed.\nDuring those years, researchers theorize, atypical weather patterns produced the wrong rhythm of wind and calm needed for upwelling. Consequently, krill were so sparse that seabird chicks, unable to eat large prey, died of starvation; nests were abandoned. Beach Watch coastal surveyors documented the dead seabirds. Blue whales that usually feed off central and northern California hunkered down in lower latitudes where at least some food was available. The outlook was grim, and scientists feared that a third, fourth or even fifth year without krill could have terrible consequences on the entire ecosystem.\nIn 2007, upwelling in the California Current \u2013 albeit late \u2013 has finally set in, and preliminary results indicate these important zooplankton are returning. Scientists are guardedly optimistic that krill will rebound.\n\u201cSanctuaries cannot control natural processes that affect krill, but they can prevent human-caused stresses that compound them, such as oil pollution and other kinds of habitat destruction,\u201d said Maria Brown, Gulf of Farallones, National Marine Sanctuary superintendent. \u201cCumulative stresses could trigger a domino effect, resulting in major ecosystem impacts. With effective regulations and development of a dynamic ocean stewardship ethic, sanctuaries can enhance nature\u2019s inherent resiliency to cope with change. Sanctuaries play an ongoing, critical role in the balance of life within our world ocean.\u201d\nDespite its importance to marine ecosystems, some krill populations are exploited by humans, primarily as livestock and farmed salmon feed. Antarctic populations are heavily harvested. But off North America\u2019s west coast, recognizing its importance in maintaining ecosystem integrity, the Pacific Fisheries Management Council voted in March 2006 to prohibit commercial krill fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington.",

Photograph: Greenpeace\nI have found more than a dozen new species on my trips to Antarctica, including many sea cucumbers, one of which was named after me. There is still so much to be discovered but it\u2019s slow work for the taxonomists, and funding is scarce. On the last expedition with Greenpeace in 2022, we came across a community of tall, fragile barnacle that has yet to be described and may be years before it is actually classified.\nI knew I wanted to be a marine biologist from the age of 15. I\u2019m from Melbourne, and Australia has a long history with the Antarctic. I started volunteering at the local museum and was put to work on Antarctic sea urchins. I was hooked. Sea urchins brood their young in a little pouch near their mouth. They can have dozens of babies around them. On one female, I found 353 babies. It\u2019s pretty cute \u2013 but I know not everyone would think that.\n!\nLockhart has been studying Antarctic marine life for more than three decades. Photograph: Ariana Drehsler/The Guardian\nMy fascination and drive began with the puzzle, and working out what\u2019s what. Sometimes, you have these organisms with characteristics that were described 100 years ago, but they can be wrong (Antarctic sea urchin taxonomy is a mess). Realising as a young person that these old revered scientists could be wrong \u2013 I found that compelling.\nOn my first expeditions in the 2000s, I would join research vessels that were looking at fish stocks \u2013 but that requires trawling. I was there to look at all the bycatch which is, of course, destroyed in the process.\nOne day sticks out for me. We struggled to get the trawl back on the deck because the net contained spectacular sponges that were probably hundreds of years old. These glass sponges were like enormous vases. You could sit in them, they were so big \u2013 at least a good metre across. They\u2019re home to so many other organisms as well, such as snake stars and ice fish that hide within. Once you lose the structure that these organisms provide, you\u2019re messing with the whole ecosystem. But, if you are going to get it protected, you\u2019ve got to know it\u2019s there and in those days that was the only way to do it.\n!\nA glass sponge \u2018like...[Content truncated]",

For example, it provides foods that we eat, it balances Earth\u2019s climate, and it is a wild unknown space for people to enjoy and explore. Despite its importance, the deep sea is the least explored area on our planet because it is so big, deep, dark, cold, and salty.
