Based on a workshop of 137 krill experts we identify the challenges of observing climate change impacts with shifting sampling methods and suggest three tractable solutions. These are to: improve overlap and calibration of new with traditional methods; improve communication to harmonise, link and scale up the capacity of new but localised sampling programs; and expand opportunities from other research platforms and data sources, including the fishing industry. Contrasting evidence for both change and stability in krill stocks illustrates how the risks of false negative and false positive diagnoses...[Content truncated]",

While mostly distributed to the north, populations of chinstrap, gentoo and macaroni penguins breed on islands of the northwestern Antarctic Peninsula, overlapping with Adélie penguins. Gentoo penguins are distributed as far as temperate waters surrounding the Falkland Islands, while macaroni penguins mainly colonize Heard and South Georgia islands in proximity to the APF (). Colonies of king penguins (_A. patagonicus_), royal penguins (_E. schlegeli_) and rockhopper penguins (_E. chrysocome_) are found on sub-Antarctic islands and do not inhabit the coastal Antarctic continent. Flying birds inhabiting Antarctica and sub-Antarctic regions include skuas, petrels, terns, gulls and Albatross (, ).\nIn addition to the two penguins endemic to the sea ice zone are the endemic snow (_Pagodroma nivea_) and Antarctic petrels (_Thalassoica antarctica_), this pagophilic community increased only in summer by a few other flighted seabirds: skuas, albatross and a few petrel species. The peri-Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands, and surrounding ice-free ocean, are densely populated by many more petrel and albatross species, with sparse inclusion of skuas and larid species (, ).\n2. Early reports of mass mortality in Antarctic animals\n-------------------------------------------------------\nDue to its zoogeographical isolation, introduction of pathogens and parasites to these populations of Antarctic wildlife, particularly the endemics of high latitude, may have detrimental effects. Understanding these potential effects required a knowledge of the entities circulating in the ecosystem. This concern drove interest toward detecting viruses, bacteria and parasites among Antarctic animals providing insight to their health. There have been a few reported cases of mass mortality where the disease-causing agent was undetermined. In 1971, several hundred gentoo penguin chicks at a Signey Island colony, South Orkneys, were found dead (). Although symptoms were described as similar to puffinosis coronavirus infection, no isolation of the disease agent was possible (). In 1972, about 65% of Adélie penguin chicks were reported...[Content truncated]",

Strict quality control was applied on the generated results. A high load of residual materials in pooled samples hampered the analysis and avoided a reliable determination of putative MP particles. Individual krill stomachs displayed reliable results, however, only after re-treating the samples with hydrogen peroxide. Before this treatment, lipid rich residues of krill resulted in false assignments of polymer categories and hence, false high MP particle numbers. Finally, MP was identified in 4 stomachs out of 60, with only one MP particle per stomach. Our study highlights the importance of strict quality control to verify results before coming to a final decision on MP contamination in the environment to aid the establishment of suitable internationally standardized protocols for sampling and analysis of MP in organisms including their habitats in Southern Ocean and worldwide.\nKeywords\n--------\nAntarctic krill\n_Euphausia superba_\nMicroplastic\nSouthern Ocean\nQuality control\nFTIR, fatty acids\nData availability\n-----------------\nData will be made available on request.\nCited by (0)\n------------\nThese authors contributed equally to the manuscript.\nPresent Address.

The tools provided by KBs to produce field guides could be particularly helpful for Antarctic biologists, as there is a real need for generating new Antarctic field guides or updating existing ones. A relatively low number of field guides to the flora and fauna of Antarctica have been made available in comparison to temperate and tropical regions (Brueggeman 1998, Hibberd & Moore 2009, Rauschert & Arntz 2015, Schories & Kohlberg 2016, https://niwa.co.nz/coasts-and-oceans/marine-identificationguides-and-fact-sheets/amazing-antarctic-asteroids). In addition, regarding the marine fauna and flora of the Southern Ocean, it appears that the biodiversity of the Antarctic zone has been assessed more often (Brueggeman 1998, Rauschert & Arntz 2015, Schories & Kohlberg 2016 than the species of the sub-Antarctic islands (however, see Fischer & Hureau 1985, Hibberd & Moore 2009), in nearshore habitats in particular (Féral et al. 2019). ...\n...

Antarctic seabirds are vulnerable to all these threats because they depend on terrestrial and marine environments to breed and forage. We assess the current distribution and total abundance of Adélie penguins in East Antarctica and find there are 3.5 (95% CI 2.9–4.2) million individuals of breeding age along the East Antarctic coastline and 5.9 (4.2–7.7) million individuals foraging in the adjacent ocean after the breeding season. One third of the breeding population numbering over 1 million individuals breed within 10 km of research stations, highlighting the potential for human activities to impact Adélie penguin populations despite their current high abundance. The 16 Antarctic Specially Protected Areas currently designated in East Antarctica offer protection to breeding populations close to stations in four of six regional populations. The East Antarctic breeding population consumes an average of 193 500 tonnes of krill and 18 800 tonnes of fish during a breeding season, with consumption peaking at the end of the breeding season. These findings can inform future conservation management decisions in the terrestrial environment under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to develop a systematic network of protected areas, and in the marine environment under the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources to allow the consumption needs of Adélie penguins to be taken into account when setting fishery catch limits. Extending this work to other penguin, flying seabird, seal and whale species is a priority for conservation management in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.\nKeywords\n--------\nAbundance\nArea protection\nFisheries management\nSeabird\nCited by (0)\n------------\n© 2016 The Authors.

This evolutionary history consists of major events on a wide range of time scales such as the formation of the Antarctic Polar Front (25–41 million years ago) to repeated glacial cycles during the past million years. These factors variably influenced genetic connectivity of fauna to produce a highly unique, but incredibly diverse marine community. Use of molecular phylogeographic methods is creating the need to revise our understanding of Antarctic patterns of biodiversity. In particular, almost every phylogeographic study carried out to date, suggests that the biodiversity of Antarctic marine shelf fauna is considerably underestimated. In discovering this diversity, some lineages (i.e., cryptic lineages) show no diagnostic morphological differences whereas others (i.e., unrecognized species) show differences that were unknown to science. The sea star genus _Odontaster_ is among the best-studied of Antarctic invertebrate groups. Nonetheless, two unrecognized lineages were recently discovered along the Antarctic Peninsula, which is one of the best-st...[Content truncated]",

They feed almost exclusively on krill, straining huge volumes of ocean water through their baleen plates (which hang from the roof of the mouth and work like a sieve). Some of the biggest individuals may eat up to 6 tons of krill a day. Blue whales are found in all oceans except the Arctic Ocean. There are five currently recognized subspecies of blue whales.",
