He dove to an astounding depth of 86 m without any breathing equipment.\nA mouthful of seawater may contain millions of bacterial cells, hundreds of thousands of phytoplankton and tens of thousands of zooplankton.\nThe Great Barrier Reef, measuring 2,300 km in length covering an area more extensive than Britain, is the largest living structure on Earth and can be seen from space. Its reefs are made up of 400 species of coral, supporting well over 2,000 different fish, 4,000 species of mollusc and countless other invertebrates. It should really be named âGreat Barrier of Reefsâ, as it is not one long solid structure but made up of nearly 3,000 individual reefs and 1,000 islands. Other huge barrier reefs include the barrier reefs of New Caledonia, the Mesoamerican (Belize) barrier reef, and the large barrier reefs of Fiji. The largest coral atoll complexes occur in the Maldive-Lakshadweep ecoregion of the central Indian Ocean and in Micronesia.\nFish supply the greatest percentage of the worldâs protein consumed by humans and most of the worldâs major fisheries are being fished at levels above their maximum sustainable yield; some regions are severely overfished.\nMore than 90% of the trade between countries is carried by ships and about half the communications between nations use underwater cables.\nSwordfish and marlin are the fastest fish in the ocean reaching speeds up to 121 kph in quick bursts; bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) may reach sustained speeds up to 90 kph.\n\nBlue whales are the largest animals on our planet ever (exceeding the size of the greatest known dinosaurs) and have hearts the size of small cars.\nOarfish (Regalecus glesne), are the longest bony fish in the world. They have a snakelike body sporting a magnificent red fin and can grow up to 17 m in length! They have a distinctive horse-like face and blue gills, and are thought to account for many sea-serpent sightings.\nMany fish can change sex during the course of their lives.

Miles from shore on storm-tossed seas, with nothing but water in all directions--including straight down--a sailor or fisherman cannot help but wonder what lurks in the depths. When the oceans were still unexplored, these fears often took the form of imaginary monsters.\nMany sea monsters include features from living animals. A large tentacle becomes part of a monstrous sea serpent or many-armed kraken: The eye sees a fragment, the mind fills in the rest. A blend of tall tales, mistaken identity, and resonant cultural symbols, stories of sea monsters often reveal more about the minds of the imaginers than they do about the natural world.\n\"It was a giant squid twenty-five feet long. It was heading toward the Nautilus, swimming backward very fast.... We could clearly make out the 250 suckers lining the inside of its tentacles, some of which fastened onto the glass panel of the lounge. The monster's mouth--a horny beak like that of a parakeet--opened and closed vertically.... What a whim of nature! A bird's beak in a mollusk!\"\n\\--Jules Verne,Â _Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea_, 1870\n#### Many-armed monster\nThe mythical kraken may be the largest sea monster ever imagined.

And roughly 2,000 blue whales â perhaps a sixth of the global population â generally feed here. But in 2005 and 2006, all that changed.\nDuring those years, researchers theorize, atypical weather patterns produced the wrong rhythm of wind and calm needed for upwelling. Consequently, krill were so sparse that seabird chicks, unable to eat large prey, died of starvation; nests were abandoned. Beach Watch coastal surveyors documented the dead seabirds. Blue whales that usually feed off central and northern California hunkered down in lower latitudes where at least some food was available. The outlook was grim, and scientists feared that a third, fourth or even fifth year without krill could have terrible consequences on the entire ecosystem.\nIn 2007, upwelling in the California Current â albeit late â has finally set in, and preliminary results indicate these important zooplankton are returning. Scientists are guardedly optimistic that krill will rebound.\nâSanctuaries cannot control natural processes that affect krill, but they can prevent human-caused stresses that compound them, such as oil pollution and other kinds of habitat destruction,â said Maria Brown, Gulf of Farallones, National Marine Sanctuary superintendent. âCumulative stresses could trigger a domino effect, resulting in major ecosystem impacts. With effective regulations and development of a dynamic ocean stewardship ethic, sanctuaries can enhance natureâs inherent resiliency to cope with change. Sanctuaries play an ongoing, critical role in the balance of life within our world ocean.â\nDespite its importance to marine ecosystems, some krill populations are exploited by humans, primarily as livestock and farmed salmon feed. Antarctic populations are heavily harvested. But off North Americaâs west coast, recognizing its importance in maintaining ecosystem integrity, the Pacific Fisheries Management Council voted in March 2006 to prohibit commercial krill fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington.",

Photograph: Greenpeace\nI have found more than a dozen new species on my trips to Antarctica, including many sea cucumbers, one of which was named after me. There is still so much to be discovered but itâs slow work for the taxonomists, and funding is scarce. On the last expedition with Greenpeace in 2022, we came across a community of tall, fragile barnacle that has yet to be described and may be years before it is actually classified.\nI knew I wanted to be a marine biologist from the age of 15. Iâm from Melbourne, and Australia has a long history with the Antarctic. I started volunteering at the local museum and was put to work on Antarctic sea urchins. I was hooked. Sea urchins brood their young in a little pouch near their mouth. They can have dozens of babies around them. On one female, I found 353 babies. Itâs pretty cute â but I know not everyone would think that.\n!\nLockhart has been studying Antarctic marine life for more than three decades. Photograph: Ariana Drehsler/The Guardian\nMy fascination and drive began with the puzzle, and working out whatâs what. Sometimes, you have these organisms with characteristics that were described 100 years ago, but they can be wrong (Antarctic sea urchin taxonomy is a mess). Realising as a young person that these old revered scientists could be wrong â I found that compelling.\nOn my first expeditions in the 2000s, I would join research vessels that were looking at fish stocks â but that requires trawling. I was there to look at all the bycatch which is, of course, destroyed in the process.\nOne day sticks out for me. We struggled to get the trawl back on the deck because the net contained spectacular sponges that were probably hundreds of years old. These glass sponges were like enormous vases. You could sit in them, they were so big â at least a good metre across. Theyâre home to so many other organisms as well, such as snake stars and ice fish that hide within. Once you lose the structure that these organisms provide, youâre messing with the whole ecosystem. But, if you are going to get it protected, youâve got to know itâs there and in those days that was the only way to do it.\n!\nA glass sponge âlike...[Content truncated]",

The ship wending its way through the blue waters of the tropical archipelago is Oscar Elton Sette â a 224-foot research vessel operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, now conducting the first Hawaiâi portion of the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program in five years.\n*   ### Â \n    **July 12, 2024**Â Â |Â Â Business Times\n    The legendary oceanographer discusses her lifelong mission to protect the worldâs oceans, the growing network of Hope Spots transforming marine ecosystems globally, and why itâs not too late to make a difference.\n*   ### Â \n    **July 9, 2024**Â Â |Â Â Twin States News\n    USF and the Florida Institute of Oceanography crews prepped their new remotely operated vehicle _Taurus_ for its first mission on Monday. The remotely operated vehicle - an ROV - can reach depths of two and a half miles, opening the door for exploration of some of the oceanâs most remote areas.\n*   ### Â \n    **July 5, 2024**Â Â |Â Â Frontiers for Young Minds\n    From 200 to nearly 11,000 m (about 600â33,000 feet) below sea level and covering two-thirds of our planet, the deep ocean is Earthâs largestâand most criticalâhabitat. The deep ocean is very important to people for many reasons. For example, it provides foods that we eat, it balances Earthâs climate, and it is a wild unknown space for people to enjoy and explore. Despite its importance, the deep sea is the least explored area on our planet because it is so big, deep, dark, cold, and salty. Researchers need to use special tools such as ships and deep-sea robots to create maps, make new discoveries, and understand how the ocean works and how it affects people and the planet.\n*   ### Â \n    **June 28, 2024**Â Â |Â Â Sci Tech Daily\n    For the first time, researchers from the University of California, San Diegoâs Scripps Institution of Oceanography have led an international team to directly measure the upwelling of cold, deep water through turbulent mixing along the slope of a submarine canyon in the Atlantic Ocean.\n*   ### Â \n    **June 27, 2024**Â Â |Â ...[Content truncated]",
