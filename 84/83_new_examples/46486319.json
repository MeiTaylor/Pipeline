Captivated by the light, he walks towards it, and as he approaches, the light begins to move, prompting him to follow. The scene shifts to an urban street where several buildings are visible, some of which are illuminated by street lamps and light beams projected from above, including a glowing object emitting rays that indicate activity in the area. The man continues his pursuit of the light, which leads him to a building with multiple floors, where he enters and begins to ascend the stairs. His journey is marked by scenes of empty streets and lonely sidewalks, enhancing the ambiance of a quiet urban night. As he reaches the rooftop, the video culminates with the man standing at the edge, looking out over the cityscape, illuminated by the distant glow of the city lights, providing a serene yet awe-inspiring vista that encapsulates his adventure towards the captivating light that initially drew him in."
