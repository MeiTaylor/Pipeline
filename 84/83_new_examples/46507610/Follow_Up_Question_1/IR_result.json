        "Question": "Was the individual in the video confirmed to be a lookalike of Rishi Sunak, or has further verification occurred?",
        "Answer": "The individual in the video has been confirmed to be a lookalike of Rishi Sunak and further verification has supported this claim. Several sources have reported that the man in the video is not Rishi Sunak himself but rather someone who closely resembles him. For instance, a report from the Tribune India explicitly states that the video features a 'Rishi Sunak lookalike' who was seen dancing at a club in Ibiza, confirming that it is not the Prime Minister. The video has previously gone viral with claims that it shows Sunak, especially after he became Prime Minister. However, media outlets have clarified that the resemblance is simply striking but that the individual is not Sunak. The Majorca Daily Bulletin also emphasized that the young man dancing bears a remarkable resemblance to Sunak but is indeed a 'double' of him, confirming that further verification aligns with the lookalike characterization. Additional verification found no evidence that Rishi Sunak was in Ibiza during the dates related to the video. Instead, it highlighted that he was attending other official events in the UK at that time, further substantiating that the man in the video could not be him.",
