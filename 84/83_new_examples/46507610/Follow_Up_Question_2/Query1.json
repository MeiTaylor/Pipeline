In the video, a man resembling Mr. Sunak can be seen partying.\nA Twitter user shared the video and wrote, \"UK new PM @RishiSunak in an old video dancing to the tunes, it seems UK fate is in safe hands now.\"\nClick  to see the post.\nSeveral other  and Twitter users also shared the video with the same claim. (Click ,  and  to see the posts.)\n**Fact Check**\nNewsMeter performed a reverse image search of the video's keyframe and came across a  article from 24 January 2022 titled \"'Raving Rishi living his best life when Boris gets fired': Video of Chancellor's doppelgänger throwing shapes in Wayne Lineker's Ibiza club sets social media on fire.\"\nThe article carries the viral video and states that after Wayne Lineker, the owner of the O Beach Club in Ibiza, shared a video that showed Sunak's lookalike partying in his club, the video went viral on the internet. The article also says that the real identity of the man and the date of the footage remains a mystery.\nFurther, we searched for the video on Wayne Lineker's Instagram page and found that it was posted on 12 July 2019 with the caption, \"Life's good right now!!\"\nAfter Boris Johnson resigned as the Prime Minister of the UK on 7 July this year, Lineker again  the video on 9 July and jokingly wrote, \"Rishi Sunak trying to win the Ibiza crowd over today campaigning for votes.\"\n and  also reported that a video of Sunak's doppelganger dancing in a club went gone viral after Rishi Sunak became the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\nIt is evident that the man seen in the video partying is not UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, but his doppelganger. Hence, the claim is false.",

Answering a question from a viewer on women’s-only spaces, the two political leaders debated on the Equality Act.  Sunak said he wanted to “chang[e] the law so that the old Equalities Act recognises that sex means biological sex.”  “That will allow us to […] protect female-only spaces, female-only services. It's crystal clear for you. There is a choice on that question at this election, because Keir Starmer has not matched my pledge to reform the Equalities Act to pass new law,” the Conservative leader added. “It's very important that we protect women's spaces,” said Labour leader Keir Starmer. “But what I will also say is that I do recognise that there are a small number of people who are born into a gender that they don't identify with, and I will treat them as I treat all human beings, with dignity and respect,” he continued.”",
