        "Question": "What other sources corroborate the location and identity of the individual in the Ibiza video?",
        "Answer": "The question of what other sources corroborate the location and identity of the individual in the Ibiza video can be answered through the following points:\n\n1. **Confirmation of Lookalike Status**: The Economic Times reported that the individual dancing in the Ibiza video has been referred to as a \"look-alike\" of Rishi Sunak. While the article highlights the striking resemblance that has made this man an internet sensation known as \"Raving Rishi,\" it does not confirm that this person is Sunak himself, thus supporting the identification of the individual as a lookalike [Query1_evidence2].\n\n2. **News Reports on Misleading Claims**: An article from Alt News discusses various misrepresentations regarding Rishi Sunak, which includes misleading claims about videos allegedly showing him in compromising or inappropriate situations. This indicates that there have been numerous instances where the identity of individuals in videos has been misattributed to Sunak, underscoring the public's tendency to conflate lookalikes with the Prime Minister [Query1_evidence1].\n\n3. **Timing and Other Engagements**: Additional verification noted in various sources indicates that Rishi Sunak was engaged in official events within the U.K. during the time frame of the Ibiza video. This information solidifies the case that the person in the video cannot be Sunak, as he was not present in Ibiza at that time, further affirming the claim that the individual is indeed a lookalike [Query1_evidence1].\n\nBased on this analysis of the evidence and the supporting information from reliable news sources, the confidence in this explanation is approximately **95%** given the corroboration of the claims regarding the individual‚Äôs identity and location.",
