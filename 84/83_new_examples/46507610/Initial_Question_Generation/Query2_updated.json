There is no evidence that the man in the viral video is Rishi Sunak. The video was published in July 2019 on Instagram by Wayne Lineker. It actually shows people dancing at a club in Ibiza, Spain. In recent years, Lineker has repeatedly posted the same video on social media to express his stance and attitude towards different social events.\n2.  Several media outlets and fact-checking organizations have debunked similar claims, clarifying that the man in the video is not Rishi Sunak but his lookalike. The French news channel France 24 has pointed out that Sunak has a mole on the left side of his face, but the man in the video does not.\n3.  According to Sunak\u2019s official social media accounts, in July 2019, he stayed in the U.K. and attended various events in the country. Therefore, he did not go to Ibiza in Spain, nor he appeared in the viral video.\n**Our verdict**: The man dancing in the viral video is not Britain\u2019s new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\nNews Brief\nA  of a man dancing was shared Oct. 26, 2022, on Twitter, with the caption \u201cBritain\u2019s new Prime Minister.\u201d It claims that the man dancing in the video is Rishi Sunak, U.K.\u2019s new Prime Minister.\nAccording to...[Content truncated]",
