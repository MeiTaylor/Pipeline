        "Question": "Does the video definitively identify the shirtless dancer as U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak?",
        "Answer": "The video does not definitively identify the shirtless dancer as U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Key points to support this conclusion include: 1. **Lookalike Claims**: The video in question has been reported to involve a lookalike of Rishi Sunak, not the Prime Minister himself. A source from India Times describes the individual in the video as a \"Rishi Sunak lookalike\" who was seen partying in Ibiza, emphasizing that this video is not of Sunak, but rather of someone resembling him. 2. **Previous Debunking**: France 24 highlighted that misleading videos claiming to show Sunak dancing have circulated widely online, and similar claims have been debunked. They specifically mention the misleading nature of such videos, implying that there are instances where videos attributed to Sunak have turned out to involve other individuals. Based on the analysis of the evidence, there is a strong indication that the individual in the video is not Rishi Sunak but rather someone who closely resembles him.",
