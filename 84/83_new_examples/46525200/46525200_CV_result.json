        "video_headline": "TIL that everyone wears Crocs in the 2006 movie Idiocracy because the costume designer had a limited shoe budget, and thought the cheap plastic shoes made by the then startup company were futuristic yet too stupid looking to ever become popular in real life",
        "video_transcript": "But, yeah, I was just thinking that so there was the wardrobe, woman, whatever. I don't know. What what do you costume designers, the official title. She, you know, she had a limited budget also and for the shoes. So this was we shot it in 2004. She goes she tells me, okay. There's a start up, and it was Crocs, but they weren't out in the world yet. But it was a small company, and she goes, look at these. There are these horrible plastic shoes with holes. So we could really save a lot of money. Just put everyone in these things. And then I said, well, what if but what if by the time the movie comes out, what if everyone's what if these become popular and people are wearing them? She said, oh, these are never gonna become popular. No one would ever wear these things. They're horrible. And then yeah. And then but then it took 2 years for the movie to come out, then everyone's but like, oh, that's pretty funny that you put everyone in Crocs.",
        "Video_descriptor": "The video begins with a man wearing a black cap and a red shirt, positioned in front of a microphone, as he speaks into it with headphones on, suggesting he is part of a podcast or radio show titled 'NoClipsBarred,' evidenced by the logo visible in the top left corner of the screen. As he continues to articulate his thoughts, the camera pans around the room, revealing an indoor setting adorned with a red curtain, which enhances the studio-like atmosphere. Throughout the visuals, the man interacts with various objects on the table in front of him, such as a bottle of water and a cup, which may serve for guests or breaks, indicating a professional and prepared setup for podcasting. Various text overlays appear on the screen during the video, showcasing snippets of his dialogue, including phrases like “Oh, these are never” and “they're horrible and then -Yeah,” which provide insight into the topics he is discussing. The video also features collaged images interspersed with his speaking moments, which showcase a range of scenes from different contexts, including a man in a costume dancing in a crowd, alongside others riding adorned vehicles, suggesting a lively, engaging environment surrounding the main podcast.

    "CVResult": {
        "Judgment": "Yes",
        "Confidence": "90%",
        "Reason": "The video information provides direct insights from a podcast discussion about the film 'Idiocracy.' It includes a first-hand account from someone involved in the production, specifically mentioning that the costume designer had a limited budget and chose Crocs for their low cost and their unattractive appearance, leading to the belief that they would never become popular. This corroborates the claim that everyone in the movie wore Crocs for these reasons, supporting it with details about the timeline and the thought process of the costume designer. Given the direct correlation between the speaker's account and the nature of the claim, one can conclude with a high level of confidence that the claim is true, though absolute certainty is reduced slightly by the subjective nature of discussions around popularity."
