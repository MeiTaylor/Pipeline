There's a start up, and it was Crocs, but they weren't out in the world yet. But it was a small company, and she goes, look at these. There are these horrible plastic shoes with holes.

  "CVResult": {
    "Judgment": "Yes",
    "Confidence": "90%",
    "Reason": "The video information provides direct insights from a podcast discussion about the film 'Idiocracy.' It includes a first-hand account from someone involved in the production, specifically mentioning that the costume designer had a limited budget and chose Crocs for their low cost and their unattractive appearance, leading to the belief that they would never become popular. This corroborates the claim that everyone in the movie wore Crocs for these reasons, supporting it with details about the timeline and the thought process of the costume designer. Given the direct correlation between the speaker's account and the nature of the claim, one can conclude with a high level of confidence that the claim is true, though absolute certainty is reduced slightly by the subjective nature of discussions around popularity."
