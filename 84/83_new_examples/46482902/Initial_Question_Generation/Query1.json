The ignition was being used to help contain the fire by taking away fuel, not to spread it.\nTHE FACTS: As more than  across Canada on Thursday, social media users misrepresented footage of containment efforts to baselessly claim it shows that the fires were deliberately lit.\nA video shared on Instagram, TikTok and Twitter shows a yellow helicopter flying above a forest filled with smoke, as a helitorch suspended from the chopper emits flames. The next shot shows a forest ablaze. Text overlaid on the footage reads: “it was a set up.”\nHowever, the footage was taken from  shared by the British Columbia Wildfire service on June 4 on YouTube. In the video, members of the fire service explain how they are using “planned ignitions” to fight the Donnie Creek blaze.\nIn the video, Mike Morrow, an ignition specialist with the service, says firefighters are stopping the conflagration from spreading by using planned burns to rob the fire of fuel. “We’re taking the fuels out on our terms rather than letting Mother Nature guide the project,” he says.\nRELATED COVERAGE\n      ]\n      ]\n      ]\n...[Content truncated]",

Whether they’ve seen it in the news or smelled it in the air, the fallout from the 2023 wildfire season is significant and scary.\nOn June 28, Toronto’s air quality was among the worst in the world, thanks to forest fires burning in Quebec and northeastern Ontario. Just a day later, more than one million Americans were under air-quality alerts as wildfire smoke drifted south of the border, causing hazy skies in big U.S. cities like New York City, Chicago and Philadelphia. NASA reported that smoke from weeks-long fires in Quebec had reached southwestern Europe by June 26.\n!\nWhile last year’s Canadian wildfire season was relatively slow, this year it has started with a bang. Elkins Eye Visuals Photo\nCompared to a relatively slow fire season in 2022, this year started with a bang in Western Canada. Crews were called out about two weeks earlier than normal in mid-April, foiling the usual staggered start that allows aerial firefighters and ground crews to ramp up at a measured pace.\nMoving into July, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC) reported 618 active fires across the country on July 3, with year-to-date blazes responsible for burning a total of 8.5 million hectares (21 million acres).\nAt VIH Helicopters in Victoria, B.C., the main...[Content truncated]",

The largest fire Paré admitted to starting destroyed more than 870 hectares.\n    \n\n            “Mr. Pare does not remember all of the fires he could have started, so we have currently 14 fires, we have 14 counts,” Charron told CNN. “It’s possible there are more but we do not have evidence of that,” she added.\n    \n\n            Charron said police and first responders grew suspicious when a number of fires happened over a short period of time without a discernible cause.\n    \n\n            Police officers became interested in Paré after he was spotted in the areas of several fires. They also found multiple social media posts by Paré accusing the Canadian government of purposefully igniting fires to persuade people to believe in climate change.\n    \n\n            “According to police evidence, the accused posted a lot of conspiracy theories about the fires...[Content truncated]",

The helicopter is not setting up wildfires but is trying to limit the spread of the existing wildfire through controlled burns.\n@dashcam\\_newyork has over 98,600 followers on Instagram, and the account's owner, @chipeoshaw is a New York blogger with an Instagram following of over 117,000.\nIn the video, that was shared on the account, a man films the TV screen, where the video of the helicopter dropping flames is playing. The man says that this was how they started the fire and called it a setup. The voice of a woman can also be heard in the background saying that it was fake news.\nThe woman continues to state multiple times that it was fake news and that it was done to clean out .

The Bloomberg video sourced planned ignition updates videos from the British Columbia Wildfire Service.\n!\nThe BBC Wildfire Service YouTube channel posted a video on June 4, 2023, that detailed how planned ignitions help . The video is titled \"Donnie Creek Wildlife - planned ignitions update June 4, 2023.\"\nIt sees Donnie Creek complex ignition and fire behavior specialist, Mike Morrow explaining how wind shifts might cause the aggressive fires to move toward communities. Morrow explains that because they were concerned about the fire moving towards areas of concern, they decided to control the  and take it out.\nHe said:\n> \"What we're doing is we're taking the fuels out on our terms rather than letting mother nature guide the project.\"\n!\nMorgan Bogeen explains that prior to the active ignition, they make a mission plan to ensure that the burn is successful. Bogeen, an Ignition and Fire Behaviour Specialist trainee, added:\n> \"We're looking at what resources will be required to hold the ignition lines, what resources will be required to light the fire, whether it be hand crews or aerial ignition or In this case we use a Heli-torch.\"\nAccording to Mike Morrow, a Heli-torch is a 45-gallon drum gelled gasoline, that the pilot suspends under the helicopter.

Yes: It's a flame-spitting helicopter.\nThere more mundane ways to set controlled burns, like a fusee (basically a handheld flare), flare guns (great for lighting a hillside on fire), or a driptorch filled with a mixture of gasoline and diesel that literally pours fire out of a spigot.\nBut all of these solutions require men on the ground, near the fire. That can be tough in rugged terrain, and requires a ton of manpower to light large areas. That's why we have the helitorch.\nThere are a couple different types of helitorch, but they all work largely the same way: combine aviation gasoline (which doesn't evaporate as quickly as standard gas) and a gelling agent (CAL FIRE uses something called ), light it on fire, and shoot it out of a giant contraption hanging a few dozen feet below a helicopter.\nThe gelling agent thickens the fuel, keeping it burning longer and improving its effectiveness as a fire starter—much like napalm. The idea is to start a continuous line of fire over hundreds or thousands of feet, even in rugged and inaccessible terrain. It also ignites the treetops, which is difficult for ground-based operations.\nAnd, like so many things related to wildfires, it looks freaking awesome.\nMost Popular\n*   \n    Gear\n    By Parker Hall\n*   \n    Gear\n    By Aarian Marshall\n*   \n    Gear\n    By Justin Pot\n*   \n    Gear\n    By Adrienne So\n]\n is a technology and automotive reporter based in Durango, Colorado.

But it’s not exactly worth a conspiracy theory if you know about firefighting.\n>    \nThe BC Wildfire Service initially posted the video on its YouTube channel. It documents the exact opposite of what many have assumed out of context. Planned ignition, also known as back burning, backfiring, or controlled prescribed burn-back, is an actual firefighting technique.\n“Planned ignitions are an essential wildfire management tool to remove forest fuels and bring the fire’s edge to established control lines with less intensity than free burning fire, thus reducing the ability for further spread,” reads the video’s description.\nAccording to the , a backburn is deliberately initiated in front of an active firefront — this can be a forest fire, grass fire, or another kind of wildfire. This doesn’t only happen aerially — it can also be done using hand-held torches.\nIt’s fighting fire with fire — literally.\n!A firefighter using a hand-held torch (BC Fire Service)\nMike Morrow, an ignition specialist working on the Donnie Creek fires with BC Wildfire Service, explains how the process works in the original video.\n“Extreme fire behaviour is occurring naturally on the north end,” Morrow says. “If we had a wind shift, \\ would be coming back to the communities and structures. What we’re doing is we’re taking the fuels out on our terms rather than letting Mother Nature guide the project.”\nHe adds that the device hanging from the helicopter in the video is called a “heli-torch.”\n!A view from the heli-torch (BC Fire Services)\n“A hel...[Content truncated]",
