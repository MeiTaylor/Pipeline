Whether they’ve seen it in the news or smelled it in the air, the fallout from the 2023 wildfire season is significant and scary.\nOn June 28, Toronto’s air quality was among the worst in the world, thanks to forest fires burning in Quebec and northeastern Ontario. Just a day later, more than one million Americans were under air-quality alerts as wildfire smoke drifted south of the border, causing hazy skies in big U.S. cities like New York City, Chicago and Philadelphia.

Elkins Eye Visuals Photo\nCompared to a relatively slow fire season in 2022, this year started with a bang in Western Canada.

Helicopter use allows for timely delivery of personnel to backcountry fires that in some cases would exceed a two-day hike. Protection of human life is the first priority on incidents. Balancing priorities between protecting communities and infrastructure, other property and improvements, and natural and cultural resources is based on the values to be protected, human health and safety, and the costs of protection.\nHelicopters and Airplanes Play an Important Role in Managing Wildland Fires\nAircraft are used for a wide variety of missions, including as an “aerial platform” from which managers have an “eye in the sky” view to coordinate ground and aerial assets.

It documents the exact opposite of what many have assumed out of context. Planned ignition, also known as back burning, backfiring, or controlled prescribed burn-back, is an actual firefighting technique.\n“Planned ignitions are an essential wildfire management tool to remove forest fuels and bring the fire’s edge to established control lines with less intensity than free burning fire, thus reducing the ability for further spread,” reads the video’s description.\nAccording to the , a backburn is deliberately initiated in front of an active firefront — this can be a forest fire, grass fire, or another kind of wildfire. This doesn’t only happen aerially — it can also be done using hand-held torches.\nIt’s fighting fire with fire — literally.\n!A firefighter using a hand-held torch (BC Fire Service)\nMike Morrow, an ignition specialist working on the Donnie Creek fires with BC Wildfire Service, explains how the process works in the original video.\n“Extreme fire behaviour is occurring naturally on the north end,” Morrow says. “If we had a wind shift, \\ would be coming back to the communities and structures. What we’re doing is we’re taking the fuels out on our terms rather than letting Mother Nature guide the project.”\nHe adds that the device hanging from the helicopter in the video is called a “heli-torch.”\n!A view from the heli-torch (BC Fire Services)\n“A hel...[Content truncated]"

This fire was located in the far northeastern part of Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve.Alaska Department of Natural Resources\nFire management in our national parks combines fire science and ecology, operations, and prescribed fire to maintain fire in the natural ecosystems while adequately considering impacts upon visitors and nearby communities, as well plant and animal habitat. Fire managers follow a plan that specifies the response to fire to be taken in an area - from monitoring and restoration of fire in the ecosystem to full suppression of fires, using a range of management tools, including aviation.\nAircraft Use Increases Firefighter and Public Safety\nWildfires, prescribed fire, hazard fuel reduction, and fire effects monitoring help restore natural processes to ecosystems. Helicopter use allows for timely delivery of personnel to backcountry fires that in some cases would exceed a two-day hike. Protection of human life is the first priority on incidents. Balancing priorities between protecting communities and infrastructure, other property and improvements, and natural and cultural resources is based on the values to be protected, human health and safety, and the costs of protection.\nHelicopters and Airplanes Play an Important Role in Managing Wildland Fires\nAircraft are used for a wide variety of missions, including as an “aerial platform” from which managers have an “eye in the sky” view to coordinate ground and aerial assets. Aircraft are also used to deliver firefighters from the air.\nAircraft are used for operational and logistical support during wildland fires.

        "Question": "Is there any evidence that the helicopter is intentionally starting the fires rather than performing firefighting efforts?",
        "Answer": "The claim that the helicopter is intentionally starting the wildfires is not supported by the evidence. Instead, the indicated actions are part of a firefighting technique known as planned ignition or backburning, which is used to manage wildfires more effectively. \n\n1. **Planned Ignition Technique**: The evidence indicates that the video showing the helicopter with a flame-throwing device is actually depicting a planned ignition. This is a common firefighting method where firefighters deliberately set fires (controlled burns) ahead of an approaching wildfire to consume fuel (like dry grass and vegetation) which could intensify the fire's spread. This approach allows firefighters to control the fire's behavior more effectively, reducing the likelihood of large, uncontrolled wildfires [Query 1_evidence_2] and [Query 1_evidence_1]. \n\n2. **Official Use of Helicopters for Firefighting**: The original footage comes from the BC Wildfire Service and illustrates how controlled burns are conducted, specifically mentioning the use of a 'heli-torch,' which is a device designed for this purpose. The video description clarifies that this practice is an essential wildfire management tool employed to bring the fire’s edge to established control lines, thereby reducing fire intensity and spread [Query 1_evidence_2]. \n\n3. **Misinterpretation and Social Media Misleading Claims**: Many claims circulating on social media misinterpret this footage, suggesting that the helicopters are responsible for starting the wildfires. However, experts and official sources clarify that these techniques are intended to mitigate fire risks rather than exacerbate them [Query 1_evidence_1]. \n\nConsidering the evidence and reasoning, it is clear that there is no reliable evidence to support the idea that the helicopter actions were intended to start fires. Instead, they are part of a deliberate strategy to manage and control wildfires effectively.",
