This fire was located in the far northeastern part of Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve.Alaska Department of Natural Resources\nFire management in our national parks combines fire science and ecology, operations, and prescribed fire to maintain fire in the natural ecosystems while adequately considering impacts upon visitors and nearby communities, as well plant and animal habitat. Fire managers follow a plan that specifies the response to fire to be taken in an area - from monitoring and restoration of fire in the ecosystem to full suppression of fires, using a range of management tools, including aviation.\nAircraft Use Increases Firefighter and Public Safety\nWildfires, prescribed fire, hazard fuel reduction, and fire effects monitoring help restore natural processes to ecosystems. Helicopter use allows for timely delivery of personnel to backcountry fires that in some cases would exceed a two-day hike. Protection of human life is the first priority on incidents. Balancing priorities between protecting communities and infrastructure, other property and improvements, and natural and cultural resources is based on the values to be protected, human health and safety, and the costs of protection.\nHelicopters and Airplanes Play an Important Role in Managing Wildland Fires\nAircraft are used for a wide variety of missions, including as an “aerial platform” from which managers have an “eye in the sky” view to coordinate ground and aerial assets. Aircraft are also used to deliver firefighters from the air.\nAircraft are used for operational and logistical support during wildland fires.

These crews range in size from three to ten firefighters and work with specialized firefighting equipment and perform many strenuous activities such as – mobile attack with engines, hose lay, construction of fireline with hand tools, burnout operations, and mopping up hotspots.\nFire Effects Crews specialize in documenting pre- and post-fire effects to vegetation and fuel. Fire Effects Crews spend most of their work time in a field environment, but also input and manage data and identify plants in an office setting. The work generally consists of collecting standard vegetation measurements, identifying plant species, and measuring wildland fuel loading. Some Fire Effects crew members also work as Fire Effects Monitors (FEMO) on planned and unplanned wildland fires where they document fire behavior and weather observations during active fires. In some cases Fire Effects crew members also participate in operational fire activities such as suppression and fuel treatments.\nFuels Crews are used primarily for working on fuels projects which include hazardous fuels reduction and restoration of fire adapted ecosystems. This work may entail thinning of timber, woodlands, or shrubs with chainsaws; utilizing prescribed fire to reduce fuels; pilling and chipping of slash; chemical application to undesirable fuels; monitoring pre and post fire effects;...[Content truncated]",

That gap only widens as seniority increases. , entry-level employees in federal fire, earn a base rate of around $13.50 per hour. A Hotshot superintendent, who’s responsible for the lives of their 20 crew members and required to hold a plethora of specialized qualifications accumulated over the course of at least a decade of experience, will enjoy a base rate of about $22.00 to $28.00 per hour.\nDefenders of the federal agencies will be quick to note that the real money to be made in fire comes with overtime and hazard pay. But even with these pay bumps, forestry technicians won’t take home anything close to their state or municipal counterparts. And federal firefighters, who work infamously long hours, can be shortchanged on overtime. It’s sometimes unavoidable that unpaid time is spent on gear maintenance or preparation for the next shift, rather than sleeping and eating, and much of the pay increase forestry technicians earn for overtime is immediately lost to a higher tax rate.\nSimilarly, the “hazardous” distinction and its attendant pay raise apply only to officially designated incidents, not to prescribed burns, fuel reduction operations, or training exercises, all of which are perfectly capable of causing injury or death and have done so in a handful of tragic accidents. This is one of a few commonly derided policy loopholes that reduce the pay of forestry technicians. Another is the lack of an official on-call designation. When they’re not on fires, many federal firefighters are required to remain within a two-hour “call-back” radius of their station and be ready to report to duty at any time, but are paid neither for travel time nor any kind of on-call wage.\nThe low hourly rate earned by forestry technicians is also meted out very differently from the pay of their peers. On wildland incidents, Cal Fire and many other agencies are paid using a ‘“portal-to-portal” system. From the moment they leave their station’s door to the moment they return, they are being paid, 24/7.\nFederal resources, on the other hand, are off the clock and unpaid between shifts, though they remain on-site at the fire for the duration of their 14-day assignments. The adoption of a portal-to-portal pay system by the federal agencies is a commonly proposed tactic to alleviate staffing problems, but so far, it’s failed to come to fruition. As of now, conventional wisdom among forestry technicians dictates that each summer, financial security comes only after working 1,000 hours of overtime, accrued in shifts ranging from ...[Content truncated]",

Over time, many wildlife species came to depend on the nourishing vegetation that burst from fire-enriched soils.\nToday, the FWC uses safely-controlled prescribed fire techniques to improve and maintain habitats for deer, quail, turkey and many other wildlife species. Some of Florida’s rare, fire-adapted plants and animals that cannot thrive without fire include the red-cockaded woodpecker, fox squirrel, gopher tortoise, indigo snake and Florida scrub-jay.\nBenefits to Wildlife\n--------------------\n!Fire’s influence on Florida’s landscape is so vital to the survival of numerous plants and wildlife species that prescribed burning is one of the FWC’s most extensively-applied habitat management practices. Many wildlife species rely on fire for maintenance of their habitat. For many species their very existence depends on the ability of  habitat to produce enough of the right kind of food. Fires promote nutritious new growth of flowering plants and shrubs as well as seed and fruit production. Many beneficial insects are also abundant after a burn.

Lincoln, PhD2 (Author affiliations at end of text)\nAirplanes and helicopters are integral to the management and suppression of wildfires, often operating in high-risk, low-altitude environments. To update data on aviation-related wildland firefighting fatalities, identify risk factors, and make recommendations for improved safety, CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) analyzed reports from multiple data sources for the period 2000–2013. Among 298 wildland firefighter fatalities identified during 2000–2013, 78 (26.2%) were aviation-related occupational fatalities that occurred during 41 separate events involving 42 aircraft. Aircraft crashes accounted for 38 events. Pilots, copilots, and flight engineers represented 53 (68%) of the aviation-related fatalities. The leading causes of fatal aircraft crashes were engine, structure, or component failure (24%); pilot loss of control (24%); failure to maintain clearance from terrain, water, or objects (20%); and hazardous weather (15%). To reduce fatalities from aviation-related wildland firefighting activities, stringent safety guidelines need to be followed during all phases of firefighting, including training exercises. Crew resource management techniques, which use all available resources, information, equipment, and personnel to achieve safe and efficient flight operations, can be applied to firefighting operations.\nAirplanes and helicopters play a major role in the control of wildland (forest, brush, and grass) fires. These aircraft are used to deliver equipment and supplies, deploy and transport firefighters, conduct reconnaissance, scout and direct operations, and deliver fire retardant or water. During the past decade, the United States has experienced an increase in the size, frequency, and severity of wildfires, likely attributable to buildup of flammable vegetation, decline in snowpack, and human development in the wildland urban interface (_1_,_2_). If these conditions continue, more fire response workers will be needed, and the demand on aviation to support these efforts will increase.\nTo identify risk factors for aviation-related wildland firefighter activities, NIOSH reviewed and extracted case reports from the Fire Administration Firefighter Fatality surveillance system, the National Fire Protection Association Fire Incident Data Organization database, the National Wildland Coordinating Group's Safety Gram, and the National Transportation Safety Board aviation database. A wildland firefighter fatality was defined as any death that occurred in a paid or unpaid wildland firefighter, contractor, aviation crew member or support staff, inmate, or member of the military while performing official wildland fire duties, including operations (fire...[Content truncated]",
