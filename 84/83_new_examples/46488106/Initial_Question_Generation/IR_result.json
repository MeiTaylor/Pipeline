The two embark on an underwater adventure in individual submersibles to try and find the treasure in a sunken ship named “Piso Mojado.” But Homer gets stuck in coral and his oxygen levels keep dipping. He loses consciousness and wakes up three days later in a hospital. In June 2023, many fans noted the parallels with the real-life disappearance of an OceanGate submersible that was carrying five passengers who were on an adventure to see the ruins of the Titanic at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. The company lost contact with the submersible, which set out early June 19 with 96 hours of oxygen and still had not been located as of June 22.\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@grandwizardchatnxggaa/video/7247292571700055302?embed\\_source=121352282%2C121351166%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%3Bnull%3Bembed\\_name&refer=embed&referer\\_url=www.newsweek.com%2Fsimpson-submersible-titanic-oceangate-predict-1808340&referer\\_video\\_id=7247292571700055302\n**Smartwatches (Season 6, Episode 19: “Lisa’s Wedding”)**\n“Lisa’s Wedding” was the show’s first foray into the future, with several technology jokes in tow that ended up coming to fruition. For example, a botched wedding proposal from Lisa’s boyfriend Hugh prompts him to call an audible by talking into his watch. In 2013, smartwatches with voice recognition first came out, saving relationships around the world.\n**Autocorrect (Season 6, Episode 8: “Lisa on Ice”)**\nThis is one of the few cases when _The Simpsons_ not only made a prediction but actively contributed to events. A quick gag has bully Dolph writing the memo “Beat up Martin” on his Apple Newton. The text then translates to “Eat up, Martha,” a clear crack at the PDA’s poor handwriting recognition. , when Apple was working on the iPhone keyboard, employees knew that was the part they had to nail. They would even quote, “Eat up, Martha” to each other to signal the feature’s importance.\n**Stealing cooking...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What specific episode of 'The Simpsons' allegedly predicted the submersible incident near Titanic's site?",
        "Answer": "The specific episode of \"The Simpsons\" that allegedly predicted the submersible incident near the Titanic's site is Season 17, Episode 10, titled \"Homer's Paternity Coot.\" This episode originally aired in 2006 and features a storyline where Homer and his long-lost father, Mason Fairbanks, embark on an underwater adventure in submersibles. During their expedition, Homer gets stuck, which parallels the incident involving the OceanGate submersible that went missing while exploring the Titanic wreck in June 2023. The episode includes themes of low oxygen and the dangers of underwater exploration, which many fans noted as eerily similar to the real-life situation faced by the OceanGate submersible that was carrying five people at the time of its disappearance.",
