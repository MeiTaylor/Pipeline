From Donald Trump's shocking presidency to the tragic events of 9/11, the animated series has often been hailed as a modern-day Nostradamus. However, its latest prediction has left fans in a state of disbelief.\n !\n2006 Simpsons episode resurfaces online, featuring a plot similar to the missing Titanic submarine incident. Fans claim another eerie prediction by the show.\nIn recent days, headlines have been dominated by the mysterious disappearance of a tourist submarine during a dive into the sunken Titanic shipwreck. The situation has escalated to a critical point, leaving five passengers on board the tourist submarine in a terrifying predicament of oxygen depletion looming over them.\nAn extensive search and rescue mission is in progress in the mid-Atlantic region, desperately seeking to find the missing submarine before it reaches a point of no return. Concerns are growing that the submersible, called Titan, might be entangled within the haunting remains of the tragic Titanic.\nHowever, what adds a spine-chilling twist to this already mysterious situation is the astounding claim made by devoted fans of The Simpsons. They insist that the animated series had actually predicted this exact scenario all the way back in 2006. The episode in question was produced by Mike Reiss, who himself embarked on a trip aboard a similar submarine called Oceangate.\nIn the episode, Homer Simpson's long-lost father, Mason Fairbanks, who specializes in salvaging lost treasures from the sea,...[Content truncated]",

It appears the show may have also \"predicted\" the disappearance of the OceanGate submersible, which lost contact Sunday while descending to the site of the Titanic wreckage with five on board.\nAmid news of the OceanGate tragedy, a 2006 episode of _The Simpsons_, titled \"Homer's Paternity Coot,\" resurfaced on social media, presenting striking similarities to current events. In the episode, Homer Simpson embarks on a deep-sea expedition to search for long-lost treasure with his biological father in tiny submersibles. After searching for a while, they come across an abandoned ship site that's filled with treasure.\nBut soon, things get hairy for the duo as oxygen levels start to be depleted after Homer accidentally gets his submersible partially stuck on a coral reef after losing his father. Homer begins to panic before he falls into a coma, only to wake up days later surrounded by family members.\nWatch the clip below.\nInterestingly, _Simpsons_ writer Mike Reiss was a passenger in the OceanGate submersible last July...[Content truncated]",

Photo: OceanGate, The Simpsons, US NOAA\nThe tragic ending to the tale of the  to the world's most famous shipwreck, Titanic, is filled with irony and some dark humour. While on the one hand, the tour company ultimately delivered THE most Titanic experience ever  - dead at the bottom of the ocean, - on the other hand, maybe _The Simpsons_ had predicted it nearly 17 years ago.\n**Did The Simpsons do it again?**\n---------------------------------\n*   American satirical animated series _The Simpsons_ is known for its eerie precognition, like predicting the Covid-19 pandemic or the arrest of former US President Donald Trump. \n*   So, when the story of the Titan submersible broke, fans of the show started claiming that the series actually predicted something similar. \n*   In Season 17's episode 10 which aired in 2006 (_Homer's Paternity Coot_), Homer Simpson begins suspecting that Abe Simpson may not actually be his biological father.\n> The Simpsons really predicted the titanic submarine situation .. and that they would completely run out of oxygen (watch till the end) this is actually scary. \n> \n> — Qura (@Qurandale) \n*   Homer finds that the wealthy treasure hunter Mason Fairbanks is his biological father and the two set off to find the lost emerald treasure of sunken ship Piso Mojado. \n*   And just the OceanGate expedition, Fairbanks and Simpson dive from a ship, each in their little sub (unlike the Titan sub), down to the shipwreck. The metal arms of the sub pick up the treasure and they head back up the water. \n*   However, Homer Simpson loses his way and gets stuck in a coral reef.  - sounds familiar? \n*   Homer Simpson passes out due to the oxygen running out, but is found by search and rescue and he wakes up from a coma three days later. And spoiler alert, turns out Homer's biological father is Abe Simpson. \n*   Anyways when the OceanGate Titan sub went missing - and it was still unknown that the sub had exploded - there was a race against time to...[Content truncated]",
