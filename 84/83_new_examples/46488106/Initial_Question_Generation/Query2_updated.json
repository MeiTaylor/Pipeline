In a world where truth can often be stranger than fiction, things that writers pitched as jokes were able to, much like the late Poochie, elevate out of frame and make their way to a new dimension.\nThe Hollywood Reporter has culled together 31 episodes, plotlines and throwaway jokes that came to fruition in our three-dimensional world.

The two embark on an underwater adventure in individual submersibles to try and find the treasure in a sunken ship named \u201cPiso Mojado.\u201d But Homer gets stuck in coral and his oxygen levels keep dipping. He loses consciousness and wakes up three days later in a hospital. In June 2023, many fans noted the parallels with the real-life disappearance of an OceanGate submersible that was carrying five passengers who were on an adventure to see the ruins of the Titanic at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. The company lost contact with the submersible, which set out early June 19 with 96 hours of oxygen and still had not been located as of June 22.\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@grandwizardchatnxggaa/video/7247292571700055302?embed\\_source=121352282%2C121351166%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%3Bnull%3Bembed\\_name&refer=embed&referer\\_url=www.newsweek.com%2Fsimpson-submersible-titanic-oceangate-predict-1808340&referer\\_video\\_id=7247292571700055302\n**Smartwatches (Season 6, Episode 19: \u201cLisa\u2019s Wedding\u201d)**\n\u201cLisa\u2019s Wedding\u201d was the show\u2019s first foray into the future, with several technology jokes in tow that ended up coming to fruition. For example, a botched wedding proposal from Lisa\u2019s boyfriend Hugh prompts him to call an audible by talking into his watch. In 2013, smartwatches with voice recognition first came out, saving relationships around the world.\n**Autocorrect (Season 6, Episode 8: \u201cLisa on Ice\u201d)**\nThis is one of the few cases when _The Simpsons_ not only made a prediction but actively contributed to events.

Each episode is filled with the Simpsons family interacting with other residents of Springfield including guest stars that appeared in some episodes on _The Simpsons_. Yet what intrigues viewers is how some events were predicted by _The Simpsons_ writers at least five years before it happened.\nSo, what did _The Simpsons_ predict? Could it be that _The Simpsons_ really predicts world events or is the world just following _The Simpsons_ script? With the 35th season of the long-running sitcom recently concluding, fans saw a return of more creative, powerful, and witty storylines that are reminiscent of the beloved classic _Simpsons_ seasons.

Since the show\u2019s debut in 1989, episodes have predicted countless events such as the pandemic, Donald Trump\u2019s presidency and Lady Gaga\u2019s halftime show, years before they happened, providing viewers with an imaginative view into the future. Emily Vanmiddendorp | Sun News Daily\nA glimpse into the future or a stunning coincidence?\nThe American animated sitcom, \u201c,\u201d has aired episodes that follow the adventures of a family in Springfield, Oregon since 1989. With currently 762 episodes, this series has portrayed scenes of Homer visiting  all the way to adding a  to the town.\nHowever, what really is captivating is the amount of times \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d have predicted an event that then occurred years later.

In this episode, Bart is shown a glimpse of 30 years into the future, where Lisa is elected president. She comments on how she succeeded Donald Trump in office.\nThis episode aired in 2000, and then 17 years later Donald Trump became president. Given how Trump is pretty open to stating his views and opinions, it would not surprise me if this mention of him being president was based on comments he made back then.\n]\n!\nSeen above is the  of Trump riding an escalator while making similar poses.\nTrump was also seen in a later episode riding an escalator. A couple of years later, a similar photo was taken of him. While riding an escalator is a fairly common thing, it is crazy that the photo between the show and reality is so similar to the hand-raised waving.\n**Pandemic**\nOne episode predicted many events that occurred in 2020. In 1993, the episode \u201c\u201d was released and showed a viral outbreak of a flu called the \u201cOsaka Flu\u201d that made its way...[Content truncated]",

Well, if you haven\u2019t, it\u2019s a lot. And they\u2019ve been right about things that, at the time of airing, seemed so wrong. So wrong they were hilarious. Like, about a former reality TV star becoming the President of the United States. Sigh.\nThe predictions ring true so often these days that you really do start to wonder if we\u2019re all living a simulation. Would that make  Morpheus or the ? Never mind.\nRegardless, there has been a number of theories that _The Simpsons_ predicted, from  a decade prior and  to .\nWe spotted a few examples back in , but there have been so many more since, so we\u2019ve had to raise the bar on what we consider freaky-good fortune-telling.\nSo, after much deliberation, here is \u2018s definitive list of _Simpsons_ predictions (for now). We\u2019re sure we\u2019ll be updating this in no time at all\u2026\n### Donald Trump becoming US President (**Season 11, Episode 17: \u2018Bart to the Future\u2019 \u2013 2000)**\nNaturally, we have to start with the one we all wish didn\u2019t come true:  winning the US Presidency. Not only did the show predict this more than 15 years before he was elected in 2016, but they even  when he announced his candidacy.\nMany have even highlighted that \u2018s appearance is strikingly similar to the current VP,  \u2013 but we\u2019re going to go ahead and believe this was more just an attempt to make her look somewhat stately. Still a pretty striking resemblance though.\n### Disney buying 20th Century Fox (Season 10, Episode 5: \u2018When You Dish Upon a Star\u2019 \u2013 1998)",

In 2002, _South Park_ season 6, episode 7, \u201cSimpsons Already Did It,\u201d aired. The episode saw Butters attempt to come up with a novel way to take over the planet, only to repeatedly discover that all of his plans had already been explored in _The Simpsons_. Meta-textually, \u201cSimpsons Already Did It\u201d was inspired by the frustration that _South Park_ co-creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker often felt when exploring new episode ideas.\nIn the years that followed, \u201c_Simpsons already did it_\" became a common cry as an increasing number of surreally specific predictions from the long-running animated comedy came true. While  and clever comedy writing, the show is equally infamous for seemingly predicting events before they occur. Some of these predictions came only a year or two before the event in question. Others arrived decades before the relevant headlines implied reality itself was plagiarizing storylines from _The Simpsons_.

While this _Simpsons_ joke became funnier 20 years later, it was not the only weird food prediction in the series. Lunchlady Doris also used gym mats as a meat substitute in another episode, which seemingly predicted the controversy over Subway using azodicarbonamide to keep the sandwich chain\u2019s bread springy.\n9 Radioactive Food Goes Global\n------------------------------\n!\nIn season 2, episode 4, \u201cTwo Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish,\u201d Marge serves Mr. Burns, a three-eyed mutated fish, as the villain campaigns for governor. The horrifying sight of a blatantly mutated fish sitting in from of him leads Burns to tank his campaign. Disgusted, he finally admits that his plant\u2019s pollution is causing a catastrophe, thus ruining his political career.
