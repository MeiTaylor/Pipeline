From Donald Trump's shocking presidency to the tragic events of 9/11, the animated series has often been hailed as a modern-day Nostradamus.

The situation has escalated to a critical point, leaving five passengers on board the tourist submarine in a terrifying predicament of oxygen depletion looming over them.\nAn extensive search and rescue mission is in progress in the mid-Atlantic region, desperately seeking to find the missing submarine before it reaches a point of no return. Concerns are growing that the submersible, called Titan, might be entangled within the haunting remains of the tragic Titanic.\nHowever, what adds a spine-chilling twist to this already mysterious situation is the astounding claim made by devoted fans of The Simpsons.

Photo: OceanGate, The Simpsons, US NOAA\nThe tragic ending to the tale of the  to the world's most famous shipwreck, Titanic, is filled with irony and some dark humour. While on the one hand, the tour company ultimately delivered THE most Titanic experience ever \u00a0- dead at the bottom of the ocean, - on the other hand, maybe _The Simpsons_ had predicted it nearly 17 years ago.\n**Did The Simpsons do it again?**\n---------------------------------\n*   American satirical animated series _The Simpsons_ is known for its eerie precognition, like predicting the Covid-19 pandemic or the arrest of former US President Donald Trump.\u00a0\n*   So, when the story of the Titan submersible broke, fans of the show started claiming that the series actually predicted something similar.\u00a0\n*   In Season 17's episode 10 which aired in 2006 (_Homer's Paternity Coot_), Homer Simpson begins suspecting that Abe Simpson may not actually be his biological father.\n> The Simpsons really predicted the titanic submarine situation .. and that they would completely run out of oxygen (watch till the end) this is actually scary. \n> \n> \u2014 Qura (@Qurandale) \n*   Homer finds that the wealthy treasure hunter Mason Fairbanks is his biological father and the two set off to find the lost emerald treasure of sunken ship Piso Mojado.\u00a0\n*   And just the OceanGate expedition, Fairbanks and Simpson dive from a ship, each in their little sub (unlike the Titan sub), down to the shipwreck.
