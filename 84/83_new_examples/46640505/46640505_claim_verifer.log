This setting transitions to an individual, dressed in a dark-colored shirt, focused intently on a computer monitor in what looks to be an office or computer lab; his desk is equipped with essential office supplies, including a keyboard and a mouse. The interaction and individual work segue into a more detailed office scene, where multiple individuals, dressed in business attire, are engaged in various tasks at their computers in a well-lit room with natural light streaming in through large windows. Additionally, a classroom setting is showcased with students seated in individual partitions, showing a lively interaction as several students raise their hands, possibly participating in a discussion or responding to the teacher’s questions. In parallel scenes, another man, wearing glasses and a suit, is seen in different office settings—one observing a Google search page on his computer in a cubicle marked with the number '85', and another deep in thought in a modern office space marked by blue partitions and bright lighting.

  "CVResult": {
    "Judgment": "Yes",
    "Confidence": "85%",
    "Reason": "The existing information provides a strong basis to evaluate the claim about North Koreans pretending to use the internet. The video transcript indicates that despite appearing to be engaged in online activities, the observed individuals were actually inactive; for example, one person was merely staring at the Google homepage without performing any searches. This detail suggests a facade rather than genuine internet use. Furthermore, the video descriptor describes a setting in which individuals are in a computer lab or office environment, yet it emphasizes the lack of typical internet usage signs, such as typing or clicking from those present. Together, this evidence strongly implies that the portrayal of internet usage was staged or superficial, thus supporting the claim of North Koreans pretending to use the internet. However, the confidence is not absolute due to the lack of direct visuals of stated inauthentic behavior, hence an 85% reliability probability."

2024-08-03 23:50:33 - ThreadPoolExecutor-33_0 - INFO - Here’s a quality evaluation of the provided websites in relation to the claim about a video showing North Koreans pretending to use the internet. Each website is assessed based on its reliability, historical accuracy, and capability to detect and expose fake news.

### Evaluation of Websites

1. **www.csis.org (Center for Strategic and International Studies)**  
   **Score: 8/10**  
   **Reasoning:** CSIS is a well-respected think tank that provides in-depth analysis on global affairs, including issues related to North Korea. Their reports and publications are written by experts in the field, ensuring a high level of credibility. However, their focus may sometimes lean towards policy advocacy, which can introduce bias. Overall, they are reliable for understanding geopolitical contexts, hence a strong score.

2. **www.wired.com**  
   **Score: 9/10**  
   **Reasoning:** Wired is a reputable publication known for its focus on technology and culture. They often investigate issues related to the internet, cybersecurity, and digital rights. Their investigative journalism is generally of high quality, making them a credible source for understanding internet claims. They do maintain a specific editorial line, but their fact-checking processes are stringent.

3. **www.cisco.com**  
   **Score: 7/10**  
   **Reasoning:** As a major player in networking and cybersecurity, Cisco provides extensive resources and white papers regarding internet technology and security. However, as a corporate site, their content may be biased toward promoting their products and services. While it is credible in its technical context, it may not be as useful for addressing political claims such as the one presented.

4. **cpj.org (Committee to Protect Journalists)**  
   **Score: 8/10**  
   **Reasoning:** The CPJ is dedicated to promoting and defending press freedom worldwide. Their reports on media conditions, particularly in repressive regimes like North Korea, add significant value to understanding the country’s internet usage landscape. They are well-regarded for their accuracy and advocacy against misinformation, enhancing their credibility.

5. **datareportal.com**  
   **Score: 7/10**  
   **Reasoning:** Datareportal provides extensive statistics and reports on internet usage globally. Their research is based on credible sources and is valuable for understanding digital trends. However, their focus is primarily on data presentations and not in-depth analyses, which may limit their capacity to discern the subtleties of claims about fake news or disinformation.

6. **www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov (National Center for Biotechnology Information)**  
   **Score: 6/10**  
   **Reasoning:** NCBI houses a wealth of scientific literature and biomedical data. While it is a credible source for health-related information and research, it does not focus on media literacy or fake news detection. Its relevance to the claim is minimal, and thus its score reflects its specialized nature rather than media-related insights.

7. **www.state.gov (U.S. Department of State)**  
   **Score: 8/10**  
   **Reasoning:** The U.S. Department of State provides official insights into international relations and policy and often reports on North Korea and related issues. Their information is reliable and provides a government perspective, but it can sometimes reflect the political stance of the U.S. government, which introduces a degree of bias.

8. **www.pewresearch.org**  
   **Score: 9/10**  
   **Reasoning:** Pew Research Center is known for its accurate and comprehensive surveys and studies on public opinion and social trends, including media consumption and technology use. Their methodology is transparent, making their findings highly credible. Their work often includes analyses on internet access globally, which can provide insights into the claim discussed.

9. **www.fbi.gov**  
   **Score: 7/10**  
   **Reasoning:** The FBI provides reliable information regarding national security, crime, and cybersecurity issues. While their reports may not focus specifically on international claims like internet usage in North Korea, their analyses are credible. However, their governmental perspective may introduce a bias toward national security viewpoints.

10. **www.iea.org (International Energy Agency)**  
   **Score: 5/10**  
   **Reasoning:** The IEA focuses on energy-related issues and its relevance to the given claim on North Korea and internet usage is minimal. While the data it provides is credible in energy contexts, it does not engage with topics of media or internet use substantially, leading to a lower score regarding relevance and applicability to the claim.

1. **datareportal.com**
   - **Website Quality Score**: 7/10
   - **Explanation**: DataReportal provides data on digital trends, including internet usage statistics and social media insights. It is generally reliable and uses reputable sources for its information. However, it primarily focuses on data, which may not cover the nuanced context of specific claims about North Korea. Therefore, while it provides valuable statistical information, it lacks deep analysis, reducing its ability to expose fake news.

2. **www.38north.org**
   - **Website Quality Score**: 9/10
   - **Explanation**: 38 North is a project of the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University that focuses on North Korean issues.

3. **www.nknews.org**
   - **Website Quality Score**: 8/10
   - **Explanation**: NK News is a well-respected resource specializing in news and analysis about North Korea.

It has a reputation for reliability and is often cited by other reputable media sources, making it a strong candidate for detecting misinformation about North Korea.

4. **en.wikipedia.org**
   - **Website Quality Score**: 6/10
   - **Explanation**: Wikipedia is a crowdsourced encyclopedia that can be a good starting point for general knowledge. However, its reliability can vary by article since anyone can edit entries. While many articles on North Korea are well-cited, the potential for misinformation exists. Thus, while useful for a general overview, it is not always dependable for detailed fact-checking.

5. **www.statista.com**
   - **Website Quality Score**: 7/10
   - **Explanation**: Statista compiles statistics and data across various sectors. While it is reputable for providing access to credible data sources, it does not specifically focus on news coverage or analysis of claims. Therefore, it can be useful for context but lacks the depth required for debunking specific news claims, particularly regarding North Korea.

6. **www.usip.org**
   - **Website Quality Score**: 8/10
   - **Explanation**: The United States Institute of Peace (USIP) focuses on conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and international relations. It has a strong record of producing research and analysis around contentious issues, including North Korea. Its credibility is enhanced by its academic and policy-oriented approach, making it a reliable source for understanding the complexities involving North Korea.

7. **www.csis.org**
   - **Website Quality Score**: 9/10
   - **Explanation**: The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) is a well-recognized think tank that provides thorough analysis on global security issues, including those related to North Korea. It is known for its high-quality research and expert insights, contributing to its reputation as a credible source in this domain.

8. **www.recordedfuture.com**
   - **Website Quality Score**: 7/10
   - **Explanation**: Recorded Future utilizes AI to provide threat intelligence and analysis, particularly in the realm of cybersecurity but also covering geopolitical issues. While its analytical and predictive capabilities are strong, it is not primarily focused on news or factual reporting, limiting its contribution to news verification.

9. **www.wired.com**
   - **Website Quality Score**: 8/10
   - **Explanation**: Wired is a well-respected technology and culture magazine with investigative reporting and analysis on current trends, including issues of security and internet access. It produces high-quality journalism, although it is not specialized in North Korean affairs specifically. Nevertheless, its overall credibility and ability to tackle misinformation are significant.

10. **cpj.org**
    - **Website Quality Score**: 9/10
    - **Explanation**: The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) focuses on press freedom worldwide. Its commitment to factual reporting and protection of journalistic integrity makes it a highly credible source, particularly when discussing media narratives around authoritarian regimes like North Korea. It is instrumental in exposing misinformation and supporting journalistic efforts globally.

In summary, the websites vary in credibility and focus, with specialized outlets like 38 North and NK News scoring the highest due to their dedicated focus on North Korean issues and robust analytical frameworks.

The incident also underlines how difficult it is for foreign companies to verify their outsourced work is not potentially breaking sanctions and ending up on computers in Pyongyang.\\n**A Month of Animation**\\nThe story begins in late 2023 with the discovery of a cloud storage server on a North Korean Internet Protocol (IP) address. The server, which appears no longer in use, had been incorrectly configured, making the daily flow of files into and out of this server viewable by anyone without a password.\\nNorth Korea employs such servers because the average IT worker inside the country does not have direct access to the Internet. Typically, an organization might have just one or two computers with Internet access; workers need approval to use them and are monitored while they do so.\\nThe cloud server in question was discovered by Nick Roy, who runs the . Together, throughout January this year, we observed files. Each day, a new batch of files would appear that included instructions for animation work and the results of that day\u2019s work.\\nThe identity of the person or persons uploading the files could not be determined.\\nOften the files contained editing comments and instructions in Chinese, presumably written by the production company, along with a translation of those instructions into Korean. This suggests a go-between was responsible for relaying information between the production companies and the animators.\\nFor example, in the communication below, the animator is being asked to improve the shape of the character\u2019s head.\\n]\\nFigure 1.

Already turning inward after the failure of diplomatic efforts in 2019, the North Korean government isolated itself further amid the global COVID-19 pandemic. North Korea has learned to operate, and Kim Jong Un has learned to rule, with greater levels of self-isolation than aggressive international sanctions regimes could ever hope to impose. Given North Korea\u2019s current mode of rejecting even humanitarian assistance and its recent turn toward Russia, the chances for diplomatic breakthroughs with Pyongyang look like a wishful long-term hope at best.\\nThe longstanding mistrust between the United States and North Korea and the intractability of the denuclearization stalemate mean that the United States should take a long-term approach that manages and ameliorates security concerns on all sides but also facilitates a...[Content truncated]\"\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"evidence6\": {\n            \"title\": \"North Koreans Want External Information, But Kim Jong-Un Seeks to ...\",\n            \"link\": \"https://www.csis.org/analysis/north-koreans-want-external-information-kim-jong-un-seeks-limit-access\",\n            \"displayLink\": \"www.csis.org\",\n            \"snippet\": \"May 15, 2019 ...

Since the signature system works on devices with the Android operating system, foreign content has been less thoroughly policed on computers. North Korea\u2019s Red Star computer operating system appears to be less effective in rooting out non-sanctioned files.\\nIn addition to the digital monitoring carried out by security officials, North Korean security personnel of \u201cGroup 109\u201d are commissioned to root out foreign media or foreign information content. Their methods involve physically inspecting digital media to find foreign media that may be stored which has not been eliminated by digital monitoring. Almost two-thirds of respondents to the InterMedia survey had personally experienced an inspection by Group 109. These unfriendly in-person encounters have no doubt increased the fear of foreign media consumption. As a result, more casual use of foreign media has been discouraged.\\nThus, it appears that the aggressive digital and security personnel enforcement of the ban on foreign media has had some effect in discouraging access to sources of external information. It appears that foreign television viewership\u2014via direct TV but more so through DVD and UBS programs\u2014has continued to grow, but other types of foreign media consumption have not shown increases.\\nThe intensity of North Korea\u2019s struggle to limit access to foreign news, information, and culture reflects Kim Jong-un\u2019s conviction that foreign media represents a significant challenge to his totalitarian regime. The influence of South Korean dramas, open media, K-Pop, fashion, and cosmetics in North Korea does represent a threat to one party rule. And that makes it all the more important that efforts continue to provide increased access to outside information for the people of North Korea.\\n_Ambassador Robert R.

This includes Apple, Samsung, and Huawei devices, as well as various social media platforms. A notable finding is the increased use of obfuscation services like VPNs and proxies to circumvent censorship and surveillance. These activities demonstrate North Koreans' growing operational security awareness and highlight the regime's ability to acquire foreign technology, potentially undermining the effectiveness of sanctions.\\nDespite stringent international sanctions, North Koreans continue to use foreign technology to access the internet for personal and professional use. Findings based on Insikt Group\u2019s recent analysis of Recorded Future Network Intelligence data associated with North Korea, building on previous analyses between 2017 and 2020, show individuals in North Korea leverage devices and services from Apple, Samsung, Huawei, and others, showcasing a sophisticated approach to bypassing government censorship and maintaining global connectivity.\\nThe analysis reveals North Koreans are not as isolated as commonly perceived. Even with sanctions in place, a select group of individuals can access the internet and utilize various technologies to stay connected. This includes using smartphones, laptops, and tablets from well-known international brands. Despite the sanctions, North Korea continues to import foreign technology, often through its trade relationships with China and Russia. \\nA select subset of North Koreans engage in activities similar to those in other parts of the world, such as browsing social media, streaming content, and playing video games. Facebook, Instagram, and WeChat are commonly used. This trend persists despite the government's efforts to control information and restrict internet access.\\nA significant finding from the report is the increased use of obfuscation services. North Koreans are now more frequently using VPNs and proxy services to evade domestic surveillance and censorship.

Since the signature system works on devices with the Android operating system, foreign content has been less thoroughly policed on computers. North Korea\u2019s Red Star computer operating system appears to be less effective in rooting out non-sanctioned files.\\nIn addition to the digital monitoring carried out by security officials, North Korean security personnel of \u201cGroup 109\u201d are commissioned to root out foreign media or foreign information content. Their methods involve physically inspecting digital media to find foreign media that may be stored which has not been eliminated by digital monitoring. Almost two-thirds of respondents to the InterMedia survey had personally experienced an inspection by Group 109. These unfriendly in-person encounters have no doubt increased the fear of foreign media consumption. As a result, more casual use of foreign media has been discouraged.\\nThus, it appears that the aggressive digital and security personnel enforcement of the ban on foreign media has had some effect in discouraging access to sources of external information. It appears that foreign television viewership\u2014via direct TV but more so through DVD and UBS programs\u2014has continued to grow, but other types of foreign media consumption have not shown increases.\\nThe intensity of North Korea\u2019s struggle to limit access to foreign news, information, and culture reflects Kim Jong-un\u2019s conviction that foreign media represents a significant challenge to his totalitarian regime. The influence of South Korean dramas, open media, K-Pop, fashion, and cosmetics in North Korea does represent a threat to one party rule.

This multinational meta-analysis fills this gap by providing estimates of its global prevalence. Two hypotheses were formulated to explain the cross-national variations. The accessibility hypothesis predicts that IA prevalence is positively related to Internet penetration rate and GDP per capita, whereas the quality of (real) life hypothesis predicts that IA prevalence is inversely related to a global national index of life satisfaction and specific national indices of environmental quality. Multiple search strategies were used in an attempt to retrieve all empirical reports from 1996 to 2012 that adopted the Young Diagnostic Questionnaire or Internet Addiction Test for assessing generalized IA. The data set comprised 164 prevalence figures derived from 80 reports, including 89,281 participants from 31 nations across seven world regions. A random effects meta-analysis showed a global prevalence estimate of 6.0% \\\\, with moderate heterogeneity (_I_2\\\\=44%, _p_<0.0001).

In late November, SPE confirmed that it was the victim of a cyber attack that destroyed systems and stole large quantities of personal and commercial data. A group calling itself the \u201cGuardians of Peace\u201d claimed responsibility for the attack and subsequently issued threats against SPE, its employees, and theaters that distribute its movies.\\nThe FBI has determined that the intrusion into SPE\u2019s network consisted of the deployment of destructive malware and the theft of proprietary information as well as employees\u2019 personally identifiable information and confidential communications. The attacks also rendered thousands of SPE\u2019s computers inoperable, forced SPE to take its entire computer network offline, and significantly disrupted the company\u2019s business operations.\\nAfter discovering the intrusion into its network, SPE requested the FBI\u2019s assistance. Since then, the FBI has been working closely with the company throughout the investigation. Sony has been a great partner in the investigation, and continues to work closely with the FBI. Sony reported this incident within hours, which is what the FBI hopes all companies will do when facing a cyber attack. Sony\u2019s quick reporting facilitated the investigators\u2019 ability to do their jobs, and ultimately to identify the source of these attacks.\\nAs a result of our investigation, and in close collaboration with other U.S. government departments and agencies, the FBI now has enough information to conclude that the North Korean government is responsible for these actions. While the need to protect sensitive sources and methods precludes us from sharing all of this information, our conclusion is based, in part, on the following:\\n*   Technical analysis of the data deletion malware used in this attack revealed links to other malware that the FBI knows North Korean actors previously developed. For example, there were similarities in specific lines of code, encryption algorithms, data deletion methods, and compromised networks.\\n*   The FBI also observed significant overlap between the infrastructure used in this attack and other malicious cyber activity the U.S. government has previously linked directly to North Korea. For example, the FBI discovered that several Internet protocol (IP) addresses associated with known North Korean infrastructure communicated with IP addresses that were hardcoded into the data deletion malware used in this attack.\\n*   Separately, the tools used in...[Content truncated]\"\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"evidence9\": {\n            \"title\": \"The carbon footprint of streaming video: fact-checking the headlines ...\",\n            \"link\": \"https://www.iea.org/commentaries/the-carbon-footprint-of-streaming-video-fact-checking-the-headlines\",\n            \"displayLink\": \"www.iea.org\",\n            \"snippet\": \"Dec 11, 2020 ...

With few options left for entertainment, streaming services are taking off. In this commentary, we examine the carbon footprint of these services.\\nStreaming services are associated with energy use and carbon emissions from devices, network infrastructure and data centres. Yet, contrary to a slew of recent misleading media coverage, the climate impacts of streaming video remain relatively modest, particularly compared to other activities and sectors.\\nDrawing on  and other credible sources, we expose the flawed assumptions in one widely reported estimate of the emissions from watching 30 minutes of Netflix. These exaggerate the actual climate impact by up 90 times.\\nThe relatively low climate impact of streaming video today is thanks to rapid improvements in the energy efficiency of data centres, networks and devices. But slowing efficiency gains, rebound effects and new demands from emerging technologies, including  (AI) and , raise increasing concerns about the overall environmental impacts of the sector over the coming decades.\\n**Update 11/12/2020:** The energy intensity figures for data centres and data transmission networks were updated to reflect more recent data and research.

2024-08-03 23:50:59 - ThreadPoolExecutor-33_1 - INFO - 1. **evidence0**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 10
   - **Justification**: This piece of evidence explicitly states that the internet, as understood globally, remains unavailable to the everyday citizens of North Korea, with fewer than 10,000 individuals accessing international websites, primarily consisting of foreign expatriates and political elite. This directly contradicts the claim that North Koreans in the video are genuinely using the internet.

2. **evidence1**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 9
   - **Justification**: This evidence elaborates on the limited internet access in North Korea, explaining that most workers do not have direct access to the internet and only a select few computers may be allowed for such access. This reinforces the idea that the activities in the video may not represent genuine internet usage by the population depicted.

3. **evidence2**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 8
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses the vanishing of North Korean websites and suggests a revision in their external messaging tactics. It hints at a tighter grip on information, implying that limited access exists for the general populace, further supporting the notion that the video may not reflect factual internet usage among North Koreans.

4. **evidence3**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 10
   - **Justification**: This evidence confirms that internet access is heavily restricted in North Korea, available primarily for government and select authorized personnel. Since the majority of the population is devoid of this access, it strongly supports the argument that the video likely misrepresents the actual situation.

5. **evidence4**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 10
   - **Justification**: This evidence emphasizes North Korea's extremely low internet penetration rate, stating that internet access remains blocked for virtually all citizens. This directly supports the question's inquiry about the authenticity of North Koreans using the internet in the video, underscoring that the claim is false.

6. **evidence5**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 7
   - **Justification**: Although this evidence discusses the North Korean government's isolationist policies, it does not directly address internet access specifics. However, it aligns with the notion that information access is highly restricted, implying that the situations shown in the video may not be genuine.

7. **evidence6**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 6
   - **Justification**: This evidence mentions the North Korean government's efforts to limit access to external information. However, it does not specifically address internet access capabilities and thus is less relevant to the claim being analyzed.

8. **evidence7**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 8
   - **Justification**: This evidence explains how North Koreans use foreign technology to access the internet, albeit in a limited and controlled manner. It indicates that genuine internet usage may occur, but suggests it is not reflective of the general population depicted in the video, thereby supporting the claim's dubious nature.

9. **evidence8**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 9
   - **Justification**: This information refers to the highly controlled nature of internet access in North Korea, confirming that only a very small fraction of the population can access the internet, improving the understanding that the video may not depict true internet usage.

10. **evidence9**: 
    - **RelevanceScore**: 5
    - **Justification**: While this evidence discusses censorship in North Korea, it primarily highlights media control rather than providing direct evidence about internet access, rendering it less relevant to assessing the authenticity of the claim regarding internet use in the video.

2024-08-03 23:51:01 - ThreadPoolExecutor-33_0 - INFO - 1. **evidence0**  
   **RelevanceScore**: 6  
   **Justification**: This evidence discusses the efforts of the North Korean government to limit access to foreign information and the challenges North Koreans face in accessing the internet. It suggests that access is heavily monitored and restricted, and that many North Koreans may be unaware of or unable to use the internet effectively. While it provides context for understanding the internet environment in North Korea, it does not directly address the authenticity of the specific video in question.

2. **evidence1**  
   **RelevanceScore**: 9  
   **Justification**: This evidence directly discusses the limited nature of internet access in North Korea and indicates that most people do not truly have internet access. It shows that even if some individuals are observed using computers, it does not mean they are genuinely engaging with the internet in the way Western norms expect. This provides strong support for the idea that the video may be misleading or fabricated, making it very relevant to the question at hand.

3. **evidence2**  
   **RelevanceScore**: 2  
   **Justification**: This evidence does not discuss North Korea specifically and instead focuses on global projections of internet users and access. It does not help in evaluating the reality of the internet use depicted in the video, making it largely irrelevant to the inquiry about North Korea's specific internet situation.

4. **evidence3**  
   **RelevanceScore**: 4  
   **Justification**: This evidence discusses broader issues of digital censorship in North Korea but does not specifically focus on internet access as it pertains to the claim in the video. It offers a generalizing context about the media environment in North Korea but lacks specifics to the situation described in the video.

5. **evidence4**  
   **RelevanceScore**: 1  
   **Justification**: Like evidence2, this does not focus on North Korea at all. Instead, it presents global digital behavior insights that do not apply to the specific question of internet usage in North Korea, rendering it completely irrelevant.

6. **evidence5**  
   **RelevanceScore**: 1  
   **Justification**: This evidence deals with the topic of internet addiction but does not mention North Korea at all. It does not serve to validate or disprove the claim regarding North Koreans using the internet. Consequently, it is not relevant.

7. **evidence6**  
   **RelevanceScore**: 5  
   **Justification**: This report provides an overview of human rights practices in North Korea and hints at the authoritarian nature of the regime, which could imply restrictions on internet access. However, it lacks direct information pertaining to the authenticity of internet use as shown in the video and is not as focused as evidence1.

8. **evidence7**  
   **RelevanceScore**: 3  
   **Justification**: This evidence discusses technology's future impact broadly and does not specifically address the internet situation in North Korea. It does not provide direct evidence concerning the realities of internet use in North Korea, making it somewhat relevant but weakly so.

9. **evidence8**  
   **RelevanceScore**: 1  
   **Justification**: Similar to evidence2 and evidence5, this evidence is unrelated to the specific context of the internet in North Korea. It pertains to a cyber incident unrelated to general internet access among North Koreans.

10. **evidence9**  
    **RelevanceScore**: 1  
    **Justification**: This evidence focuses on the environmental impact of streaming services, which is entirely unrelated to the internet access or usage in North Korea. Therefore, it holds no relevance to the question at hand.

    "content": "*   April 22, 2024\n*   \n]A misconfigured North Korean Internet cloud server has provided a fascinating glance into the world of North Korean animation outsourcing and how foreign companies might be inadvertently employing North Korean companies on information technology (IT) projects. The incident also underlines how difficult it is for foreign companies to verify their outsourced work is not potentially breaking sanctions and ending up on computers in Pyongyang.\n**A Month of Animation**\nThe story begins in late 2023 with the discovery of a cloud storage server on a North Korean Internet Protocol (IP) address. The server, which appears no longer in use, had been incorrectly configured, making the daily flow of files into and out of this server viewable by anyone without a password.\nNorth Korea employs such servers because the average IT worker inside the country does not have direct access to the Internet. Typically, an organization might have just one or two computers with Internet access; workers need approval to use them and are monitored while they do so.\nThe cloud server in question was discovered by Nick Roy, who runs the .

    "Useful": "yes",
    "Reason": "The provided evidence is relevant and informative in addressing the New_Question about whether North Koreans are genuinely using the internet, which is a key point of the Claim. The evidence demonstrates that internet access in North Korea is extremely limited, with fewer than 10,000 people estimated to have access to international websites, suggesting that the vast majority of North Koreans remain offline. For instance, Query2_evidence_2 states that more than 99.9% of the country's population remains offline as of early 2024. This directly contradicts the implication in the video that North Koreans are using the internet in a meaningful way. Additionally, evidence from Query2_evidence_3 supports the claim of restricted access, indicating that average IT workers in North Korea typically do not have direct access to the internet and must work under supervision when using it. Therefore, the evidence not only refutes the possibility that the depicted scenarios in the video reflect genuine internet use, but it also provides essential context about the state of internet access in North Korea overall. Given the clear factual information and the credibility of the sources, the evidence is indeed useful for evaluating the truthfulness of the Claim."

The incident also underlines how difficult it is for foreign companies to verify their outsourced work is not potentially breaking sanctions and ending up on computers in Pyongyang.\n**A Month of Animation**\nThe story begins in late 2023 with the discovery of a cloud storage server on a North Korean Internet Protocol (IP) address. The server, which appears no longer in use, had been incorrectly configured, making the daily flow of files into and out of this server viewable by anyone without a password.\nNorth Korea employs such servers because the average IT worker inside the country does not have direct access to the Internet. Typically, an organization might have just one or two computers with Internet access; workers need approval to use them and are monitored while they do so.\nThe cloud server in question was discovered by Nick Roy, who runs the .

2024-08-03 23:51:27 - Thread-668 (process_claim_verification) - INFO - The evidence suggests that there is no genuine indication that North Koreans are using the internet as depicted in the video shared on social media in March 2024. 

1. **Internet Accessibility**: As of April 2024, it has been noted that the internet, as accessible to the rest of the world, remains largely blocked for everyday citizens in North Korea. Reports indicate that fewer than 10,000 people may have access to international websites, primarily comprising foreign expatriates and political elites. This means that over 99.9% of the population is still offline, and thus, the portrayal of North Koreans using the internet in a conventional sense is misleading [Query2_evidence2].

2. **Limited Usage in Controlled Environments**: While there are instances of computers in formal settings within North Korea, these are often not connected to the global internet. Instead, these environments are characterized by significant restrictions, where access is controlled, monitored, and frequently nonexistent for the average citizen. Much of the activity shown might be staged or operate within the confines of a state-controlled information network that is not representative of true internet use [Query2_evidence3].

3. **Low Internet Penetration**: Data from Statista indicates that North Korea has an extremely low internet penetration rate. This lack of access makes it highly improbable that the scenes depicted in the video represent actual usage of the internet by the general populace, as the infrastructure for such access is largely unavailable [Query2_evidence1].

In conclusion, the video likely depicts a fabricated or highly controlled representation of internet use, rather than genuine access and utilization by North Korean citizens. Therefore, my confidence in this analysis is 90%, given the evidence presented and the established understanding of internet access in North Korea.

  "CVResult": {
    "Judgment": "Yes",
    "Confidence": "90%",
    "Reason": "The existing information is sufficient to determine the truthfulness of the claim that North Koreans are genuinely using the internet. The video shared on social media presents a portrayal of North Koreans in a computer lab appearing to use the internet. However, the analysis provided indicates that there are no genuine indications of real internet use, as access to international websites remains largely unavailable to the vast majority of the population in North Korea. It is stated that fewer than 10,000 individuals have access to the global internet, primarily consisting of foreign expatriates and political elites, leaving over 99.9% of the population offline. The video likely depicts a staged or controlled representation of internet use, consistent with the restrictive nature of information access in North Korea. Additionally, there is a significant emphasis on the silence and lack of typical computer activity in the video, which supports the view that the scene does not reflect true internet usage. Therefore, with a confidence level of 90%, we can conclude that the claim is misleading and based on insufficient grounds regarding actual internet usage in North Korea."

  "Claim": "Video shared on social media in March 2024 shows North Koreans pretending to use the internet.",
  "Video_information": {'video_date': 20240311.0, 'platform': 'twitter', 'video_headline': 'North Korea: Yes we have internet access  The internet in North Korea be like:', 'video_transcript': "Next, they took us to a computer lab where students were using the internet and your first thought is, okay, this looks like any lab at a university back home but then it dawns on you that it's completely silent. No one is doing anything. There is no typing, no mouse clicking, nothing. We saw one guy looking at the Google homepage but he wasn't searching for anything. He was just staring blankly at the screen.", 'Video_descriptor': "The video opens in a formal indoor environment, possibly an office or a study hall, where a man in glasses and a dark suit is observed gesturing or speaking to a woman in a patterned dress amidst a backdrop of a long corridor lined with desks and computers, indicating a formal or professional session might be underway. This setting transitions to an individual, dressed in a dark-colored shirt, focused intently on a computer monitor in what looks to be an office or computer lab; his desk is equipped with essential office supplies, including a keyboard and a mouse. The interaction and individual work segue into a more detailed office scene, where multiple individuals, dressed in business attire, are engaged in various tasks at their computers in a well-lit room with natural light streaming in through large windows. Additionally, a classroom setting is showcased with students seated in individual partitions, showing a lively interaction as several students raise their hands, possibly participating in a discussion or responding to the teacher’s questions. In parallel scenes, another man, wearing glasses and a suit, is seen in different office settings—one observing a Google search page on his computer in a cubicle marked with the number '85', and another deep in thought in a modern office space marked by blue partitions and bright lighting. Throughout the video, the focus consistently returns to the office setting, capturing typical office activities like typing and browsing, while also hinting at an educational context where learning and interaction continue concurrently, encapsulating a typical day in interconnected professional and educational environments."},
  "QA_CONTEXTS": {'Initial_Question_Generation': {'Question': 'Is there any evidence that North Koreans are genuinely using the internet in the video?', 'Answer': 'The evidence suggests that there is no genuine indication that North Koreans are using the internet as depicted in the video shared on social media in March 2024. As of April 2024, it has been noted that the internet, as accessible to the rest of the world, remains largely blocked for everyday citizens in North Korea. Reports indicate that fewer than 10,000 people may have access to international websites, primarily comprising foreign expatriates and political elites. This means that over 99.9% of the population is still offline, and thus, the portrayal of North Koreans using the internet in a conventional sense is misleading. While there are instances of computers in formal settings within North Korea, these are often not connected to the global internet. Instead, these environments are characterized by significant restrictions, where access is controlled, monitored, and frequently nonexistent for the average citizen. Much of the activity shown might be staged or operate within the confines of a state-controlled information network that is not representative of true internet use. Data from Statista indicates that North Korea has an extremely low internet penetration rate. This lack of access makes it highly improbable that the scenes depicted in the video represent actual usage of the internet by the general populace, as the infrastructure for such access is largely unavailable. In conclusion, the video likely depicts a fabricated or highly controlled representation of internet use, rather than genuine access and utilization by North Korean citizens.', 'Confidence': '90%'}},
