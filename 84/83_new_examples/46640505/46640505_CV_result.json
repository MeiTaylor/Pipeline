No one is doing anything. There is no typing, no mouse clicking, nothing. We saw one guy looking at the Google homepage but he wasn't searching for anything. He was just staring blankly at the screen.",
        "Video_descriptor": "The video opens in a formal indoor environment, possibly an office or a study hall, where a man in glasses and a dark suit is observed gesturing or speaking to a woman in a patterned dress amidst a backdrop of a long corridor lined with desks and computers, indicating a formal or professional session might be underway. This setting transitions to an individual, dressed in a dark-colored shirt, focused intently on a computer monitor in what looks to be an office or computer lab; his desk is equipped with essential office supplies, including a keyboard and a mouse. The interaction and individual work segue into a more detailed office scene, where multiple individuals, dressed in business attire, are engaged in various tasks at their computers in a well-lit room with natural light streaming in through large windows. Additionally, a classroom setting is showcased with students seated in individual partitions, showing a lively interaction as several students raise their hands, possibly participating in a discussion or responding to the teacher’s questions. In parallel scenes, another man, wearing glasses and a suit, is seen in different office settings—one observing a Google search page on his computer in a cubicle marked with the number '85', and another deep in thought in a modern office space marked by blue partitions and bright lighting. Throughout the video, the focus consistently returns to the office setting, capturing typical office activities like typing and browsing, while also hinting at an educational context where learning and interaction continue concurrently, encapsulating a typical day in interconnected professional and educational environments."

            "Secondary_Question_1": "What specific instances in the video suggest a lack of genuine internet use?",

            "Secondary_Question_3": "Are there any corroborating sources that confirm internet access is widespread in North Korea?",
            "Secondary_Question_4": "What context or background exists regarding the authenticity of North Korean internet claims?"
        },
        "Question": "Is there any evidence that North Koreans are genuinely using the internet in the video?",
        "Answer": "The evidence suggests that there is no genuine indication that North Koreans are using the internet as depicted in the video shared on social media in March 2024. As of April 2024, it has been noted that the internet, as accessible to the rest of the world, remains largely blocked for everyday citizens in North Korea. Reports indicate that fewer than 10,000 people may have access to international websites, primarily comprising foreign expatriates and political elites. This means that over 99.9% of the population is still offline, and thus, the portrayal of North Koreans using the internet in a conventional sense is misleading. While there are instances of computers in formal settings within North Korea, these are often not connected to the global internet. Instead, these environments are characterized by significant restrictions, where access is controlled, monitored, and frequently nonexistent for the average citizen. Much of the activity shown might be staged or operate within the confines of a state-controlled information network that is not representative of true internet use. Data from Statista indicates that North Korea has an extremely low internet penetration rate. This lack of access makes it highly improbable that the scenes depicted in the video represent actual usage of the internet by the general populace, as the infrastructure for such access is largely unavailable. In conclusion, the video likely depicts a fabricated or highly controlled representation of internet use, rather than genuine access and utilization by North Korean citizens.",

    "CVResult": {
        "Judgment": "Yes",
        "Confidence": "90%",
        "Reason": "The existing information is sufficient to determine the truthfulness of the claim that North Koreans are genuinely using the internet. The video shared on social media presents a portrayal of North Koreans in a computer lab appearing to use the internet. However, the analysis provided indicates that there are no genuine indications of real internet use, as access to international websites remains largely unavailable to the vast majority of the population in North Korea. It is stated that fewer than 10,000 individuals have access to the global internet, primarily consisting of foreign expatriates and political elites, leaving over 99.9% of the population offline. The video likely depicts a staged or controlled representation of internet use, consistent with the restrictive nature of information access in North Korea. Additionally, there is a significant emphasis on the silence and lack of typical computer activity in the video, which supports the view that the scene does not reflect true internet usage. Therefore, with a confidence level of 90%, we can conclude that the claim is misleading and based on insufficient grounds regarding actual internet usage in North Korea."

    "Final_Judgement": {
        "Answer": "False",
        "Reasons": "The video claims that North Koreans are using the internet, but the evidence indicates that genuine internet access for the general populace in North Korea is virtually non-existent. Reports suggest that fewer than 10,000 people have access to international websites, predominantly expatriates and political elites, meaning that over 99.9% of the population remains offline. This starkly contradicts the video's portrayal of typical internet use. It suggests that the scenes shown are either fabricated or highly controlled representations of internet use within a limited, state-controlled environment where access to the global internet is severely restricted and monitored [Initial_Question_Generation_Query 1_evidence 1].",
