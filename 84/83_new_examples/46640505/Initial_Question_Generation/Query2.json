The incident also underlines how difficult it is for foreign companies to verify their outsourced work is not potentially breaking sanctions and ending up on computers in Pyongyang.\n**A Month of Animation**\nThe story begins in late 2023 with the discovery of a cloud storage server on a North Korean Internet Protocol (IP) address. The server, which appears no longer in use, had been incorrectly configured, making the daily flow of files into and out of this server viewable by anyone without a password.\nNorth Korea employs such servers because the average IT worker inside the country does not have direct access to the Internet. Typically, an organization might have just one or two computers with Internet access; workers need approval to use them and are monitored while they do so.\nThe cloud server in question was discovered by Nick Roy, who runs the . Together, throughout January this year, we observed files. Each day, a new batch of files would appear that included instructions for animation work and the results of that day’s work.\nThe identity of the person or persons uploading the files could not be determined.\nOften the files contained editing comments and instructions in Chinese, presumably written by the production company, along with a translation of those instructions into Korean. This suggests a go-between was responsible for relaying information between the production companies and the animators.\nFor example, in the communication below, the animator is being asked to improve the shape of the character’s head.\n]\nFigure 1. A screenshot of a document on which a Chinese comment has been translated into Korean.\nThe identity of the North Korean partner was never revealed in any of the documentation observed, but it is likely the April 26 Animation Studio, also known as SEK Studio. The Pyongyang-based organization is North Korea’s premier animation house, producing series for domestic television broadcasts, including the popular “S...[Content truncated]",

Since the signature system works on devices with the Android operating system, foreign content has been less thoroughly policed on computers. North Korea’s Red Star computer operating system appears to be less effective in rooting out non-sanctioned files.\nIn addition to the digital monitoring carried out by security officials, North Korean security personnel of “Group 109” are commissioned to root out foreign media or foreign information content. Their methods involve physically inspecting digital media to find foreign media that may be stored which has not been eliminated by digital monitoring. Almost two-thirds of respondents to the InterMedia survey had personally experienced an inspection by Group 109. These unfriendly in-person encounters have no doubt increased the fear of foreign media consumption. As a result, more casual use of foreign media has been discouraged.\nThus, it appears that the aggressive digital and security personnel enforcement of the ban on foreign media has had some effect in discouraging access to sources of external information. It appears that foreign television viewership—via direct TV but more so through DVD and UBS programs—has continued to grow, but other types of foreign media consumption have not shown increases.\nThe intensity of North Korea’s struggle to limit access to foreign news, information, and culture reflects Kim Jong-un’s conviction that foreign media represents a significant challenge to his totalitarian regime. The influence of South Korean dramas, open media, K-Pop, fashion, and cosmetics in North Korea does represent a threat to one party rule. And that makes it all the more important that efforts continue to provide increased access to outside information for the people of North Korea.\n_Ambassador Robert R. King is a senior adviser in the Office of the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. Previously, Ambassador King served as special envoy for North Korean human rights issues at the U.S. Department of State from November 2009 to January 2017._\n**_Commentary_** **is produced by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a private, tax-exempt institution focusing on international public policy issues.

This includes Apple, Samsung, and Huawei devices, as well as various social media platforms. A notable finding is the increased use of obfuscation services like VPNs and proxies to circumvent censorship and surveillance. These activities demonstrate North Koreans' growing operational security awareness and highlight the regime's ability to acquire foreign technology, potentially undermining the effectiveness of sanctions.\nDespite stringent international sanctions, North Koreans continue to use foreign technology to access the internet for personal and professional use. Findings based on Insikt Group’s recent analysis of Recorded Future Network Intelligence data associated with North Korea, building on previous analyses between 2017 and 2020, show individuals in North Korea leverage devices and services from Apple, Samsung, Huawei, and others, showcasing a sophisticated approach to bypassing government censorship and maintaining global connectivity.\nThe analysis reveals North Koreans are not as isolated as commonly perceived. Even with sanctions in place, a select group of individuals can access the internet and utilize various technologies to stay connected. This includes using smartphones, laptops, and tablets from well-known international brands. Despite the sanctions, North Korea continues to import foreign technology, often through its trade relationships with China and Russia. \nA select subset of North Koreans engage in activities similar to those in other parts of the world, such as browsing social media, streaming content, and playing video games. Facebook, Instagram, and WeChat are commonly used. This trend persists despite the government's efforts to control information and restrict internet access.\nA significant finding from the report is the increased use of obfuscation services. North Koreans are now more frequently using VPNs and proxy services to evade domestic surveillance and censorship. This marks a shift towards greater operational security awareness among users...[Content truncated]",

Only a few thousand privileged members of the hermit kingdom’s society can access the global internet, while even the country’s heavily censored internal intranet is out of reach for the majority of the population. Getting access to free and open information isn’t an option.\nNew research from South Korea-based human rights organization People for Successful Corean Reunification (Pscore) details the reality for those who—in very limited circumstances—manage to get online in . The report reveals a days-long approval process to gain internet access, after which monitors sit next to people while they browse and approve their activities every five minutes. Even then, what can be accessed reveals little about the world outside North Korea’s borders.\nDocumentation from the NGO is being presented today at the human rights conference RightsCon and sheds light on the regime with the most limited internet freedoms, which fall far below the restrictive and surveilled internet access in  and . For millions of people in North Korea, the internet simply doesn’t exist.\n“I was taught about the World Wide Web, and even had to memorize it for an exam, but I only knew about the internet in theory,” one North Korean defector who left the country told Pscore researchers. “I knew it was a sort of network where you can search but didn’t actually know what it was.” Another said they didn’t “know the concept of Wi-Fi,” let alone have any clue about Google.\nGetting an accurate picture of what happens within Kim Jong Un’s sealed-off state is incredibly challenging. Officials control all information flows and present state propaganda to the world. Analysts turn to those who escape and defect, at great personal risk, for a glimpse of North Korean reality. Pscore’s internet freedom report is based on 24 face-to-face interviews with defectors and a survey of 158 others. All left North Korea between 2012 and 2022.\nThe report says North Korean researcher Kim Suk-Han—all defector names within the research are pseudonyms for safety reasons—used the internet five times when they were living in the country. They had used the internet while on a trip to China and so had high expectations, they told the researchers. Instead, they faced...[Content truncated]",

These 10 countries flout the international standard by banning or severely restricting independent media and intimidating journalists into silence with imprisonment, digital and physical surveillance, and other forms of harassment. Self-censorship is pervasive.\nIn the top three countries–Eritrea, North Korea, and Turkmenistan–the media serves as a mouthpiece of the state, and any independent journalism is conducted from exile. The few foreign journalists permitted to enter are closely monitored.\nOther countries on the list use a combination of blunt tactics like harassment and arbitrary detention as well as sophisticated surveillance and targeted hacking to silence the independent press. Saudi Arabia, China, Vietnam, and Iran are especially adept at practicing these two brands of censorship: jailing and harassing journalists and their families, while also engaging in digital monitoring and censorship of the internet and social media.\nThe list addresses only those countries where the government tightly controls the media. The conditions for journalists and press freedom in states such as , , and  are also extremely difficult, but not necessarily attributable solely to government censorship.
