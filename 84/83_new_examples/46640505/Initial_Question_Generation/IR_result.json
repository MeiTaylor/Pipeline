                "content": "For 25 million North Koreans, the internet is an impossibility. Only a few thousand privileged members of the hermit kingdom’s society can access the global internet, while even the country’s heavily censored internal intranet is out of reach for the majority of the population. Getting access to free and open information isn’t an option.\nNew research from South Korea-based human rights organization People for Successful Corean Reunification (Pscore) details the reality for those who—in very limited circumstances—manage to get online in . The report reveals a days-long approval process to gain internet access, after which monitors sit next to people while they browse and approve their activities every five minutes. Even then, what can be accessed reveals little about the world outside North Korea’s borders.\nDocumentation from the NGO is being presented today at the human rights conference RightsCon and sheds light on the regime with the most limited internet freedoms, which fall far below the restrictive and surveilled internet access in  and . For millions of people in North Korea, the internet simply doesn’t exist.\n“I was taught about the World Wide Web, and even had to memorize it for an exam, but I only knew about the internet in theory,” one North Korean defector who left the country told Pscore researchers. “I knew it was a sort of network where you can search but didn’t actually know what it was.” Another said they didn’t “know the concept of Wi-Fi,” let alone have any clue about Google.\nGetting an accurate picture of what happens within Kim Jong Un’s sealed-off state is incredibly challenging. Officials control all information flows and present state propaganda to the world. Analysts turn to those who escape and defect, at great personal risk, for a glimpse of North Korean reality. Pscore’s internet freedom report is based on 24 face-to-face interviews with defectors and a survey of 158 others. All left North Korea between 2012 and 2022.\nThe report says North Korean researcher Kim Suk-Han—all defector names within the research are pseudonyms for safety reasons—used the internet five times when they were living in the country. They had used the internet while on a trip to China and so had high expectations, they told the researchers. Instead, they faced...[Content truncated]",

Since the signature system works on devices with the Android operating system, foreign content has been less thoroughly policed on computers. North Korea’s Red Star computer operating system appears to be less effective in rooting out non-sanctioned files.\nIn addition to the digital monitoring carried out by security officials, North Korean security personnel of “Group 109” are commissioned to root out foreign media or foreign information content. Their methods involve physically inspecting digital media to find foreign media that may be stored which has not been eliminated by digital monitoring. Almost two-thirds of respondents to the InterMedia survey had personally experienced an inspection by Group 109. These unfriendly in-person encounters have no doubt increased the fear of foreign media consumption. As a result, more casual use of foreign media has been discouraged.\nThus, it appears that the aggressive digital and security personnel enforcement of the ban on foreign media has had some effect in discouraging access to sources of external information. It appears that foreign television viewership—via direct TV but more so through DVD and UBS programs—has continued to grow, but other types of foreign media consumption have not shown increases.\nThe intensity of North Korea’s struggle to limit access to foreign news, information, and culture reflects Kim Jong-un’s conviction that foreign media represents a significant challenge to his totalitarian regime. The influence of South Korean dramas, open media, K-Pop, fashion, and cosmetics in North Korea does represent a threat to one party rule. And that makes it all the more important that efforts continue to provide increased access to outside information for the people of North Korea.\n_Ambassador Robert R.

The incident also underlines how difficult it is for foreign companies to verify their outsourced work is not potentially breaking sanctions and ending up on computers in Pyongyang.\n**A Month of Animation**\nThe story begins in late 2023 with the discovery of a cloud storage server on a North Korean Internet Protocol (IP) address. The server, which appears no longer in use, had been incorrectly configured, making the daily flow of files into and out of this server viewable by anyone without a password.\nNorth Korea employs such servers because the average IT worker inside the country does not have direct access to the Internet. Typically, an organization might have just one or two computers with Internet access; workers need approval to use them and are monitored while they do so.\nThe cloud server in question was discovered by Nick Roy, who runs the . Together, throughout January this year, we observed files. Each day, a new batch of files would appear that included instructions for animation work and the results of that day’s work.\nThe identity of the person or persons uploading the files could not be determined.\nOften the files contained editing comments and instructions in Chinese, presumably written by the production company, along with a translation of those instructions into Korean. This suggests a go-between was responsible for relaying information between the production companies and the animators.\nFor example, in the communication below, the animator is being asked to improve the shape of the character’s head.\n]\nFigure 1. A screenshot of a document on which a Chinese comment has been translated into Korean.\nThe identity of the North Korean partner was never revealed in any of the documentation observed, but it is likely the April 26 Animation Studio, also known as SEK Studio.

            "content": "*   April 22, 2024\n*   \n]A misconfigured North Korean Internet cloud server has provided a fascinating glance into the world of North Korean animation outsourcing and how foreign companies might be inadvertently employing North Korean companies on information technology (IT) projects. The incident also underlines how difficult it is for foreign companies to verify their outsourced work is not potentially breaking sanctions and ending up on computers in Pyongyang.\n**A Month of Animation**\nThe story begins in late 2023 with the discovery of a cloud storage server on a North Korean Internet Protocol (IP) address. The server, which appears no longer in use, had been incorrectly configured, making the daily flow of files into and out of this server viewable by anyone without a password.\nNorth Korea employs such servers because the average IT worker inside the country does not have direct access to the Internet. Typically, an organization might have just one or two computers with Internet access; workers need approval to use them and are monitored while they do so.\nThe cloud server in question was discovered by Nick Roy, who runs the . Together, throughout January this year, we observed files. Each day, a new batch of files would appear that included instructions for animation work and the results of that day’s work.\nThe identity of the person or persons uploading the files could not be determined.\nOften the files contained editing comments and instructions in Chinese, presumably written by the production company, along with a translation of those instructions into Korean. This suggests a go-between was responsible for relaying information between the production companies and the animators.\nFor example, in the communication below, the animator is being asked to improve the shape of the character’s head.\n]\nFigure 1. A screenshot of a document on which a Chinese comment has been translated into Korean.\nThe identity of the North Korean partner was never revealed in any of the documentation observed, but it is likely the April 26 Animation Studio, also known as SEK Studio. The Pyongyang-based organization is North Korea’s premier animation house, producing series for domestic television broadcasts, including the popular “S...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "Is there any evidence that North Koreans are genuinely using the internet in the video?",
        "Answer": "The evidence suggests that there is no genuine indication that North Koreans are using the internet as depicted in the video shared on social media in March 2024. As of April 2024, it has been noted that the internet, as accessible to the rest of the world, remains largely blocked for everyday citizens in North Korea. Reports indicate that fewer than 10,000 people may have access to international websites, primarily comprising foreign expatriates and political elites. This means that over 99.9% of the population is still offline, and thus, the portrayal of North Koreans using the internet in a conventional sense is misleading. While there are instances of computers in formal settings within North Korea, these are often not connected to the global internet. Instead, these environments are characterized by significant restrictions, where access is controlled, monitored, and frequently nonexistent for the average citizen. Much of the activity shown might be staged or operate within the confines of a state-controlled information network that is not representative of true internet use. Data from Statista indicates that North Korea has an extremely low internet penetration rate. This lack of access makes it highly improbable that the scenes depicted in the video represent actual usage of the internet by the general populace, as the infrastructure for such access is largely unavailable. In conclusion, the video likely depicts a fabricated or highly controlled representation of internet use, rather than genuine access and utilization by North Korean citizens.",
