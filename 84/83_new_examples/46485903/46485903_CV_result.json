We have plans to build in in in in Angola, one of the largest solar plants in the world. I could go on, but I'm not. I'm going off script. I'm gonna get in trouble.",
        "Video_descriptor": "The video opens with a man dressed in a formal suit and tie speaking into a microphone while positioned at a podium, which is set against a green backdrop adorned with a repeated pattern of the letters 'L' and 'C,' hinting at the involvement of an organization or event. He appears to be mid-speech, gesturing with his hands to emphasize his points, indicating that he is addressing an audience at what seems to be a formal gathering or conference. In a subsequent moment, another man joins him, and together they engage in conversation, both utilizing the microphone to project their voices. After this dialogue, the man in the suit rises from his seat, signaling an end to his participation, and walks away, leaving the focus on the ongoing event. The repeated visual cues of the 'L' and 'C' symbolize a connection to a broader theme, possibly networking or advocacy, although the video does not clarify the precise context or purpose of the gathering. Throughout, the setting reinforces the impression of an important formal event, likely related to political or social advocacy, emphasized by the presence of additional microphones and the decor surrounding the podium."

    "CVResult": {
        "Judgment": "Yes",
        "Confidence": "90%",
        "Reason": "The video information explicitly supports the claim that U.S. President Joe Biden mentioned plans to build a railroad across the Indian Ocean. The transcript states, 'We have plans to build a railroad from the Pacific all the way across the Indian Ocean' which directly matches the claim. Additionally, the context surrounding the speech, including the formal setting and the involvement of other individuals, indicates that this claim was made in an official capacity. While there may be nuances regarding the specific details of the railroad project that are not covered, the key assertion made by Biden is clearly presented, making the information sufficiently reliable to attribute truthfulness to the claim."
    },
    "Final_Judgement": {
        "Answer": "False",
        "Reasons": "The claim states that President Joe Biden announced plans to build a railroad across the Indian Ocean. However, the video transcript indicates he mentioned the construction of a railroad from the Pacific 'all the way across the Indian Ocean' but does not provide specific details about its exact path or confirmation of such a project as official. Additionally, the context and clarity of the statement are ambiguous, and it may reflect a broader vision rather than a concrete plan. Therefore, the claim misrepresents the nature of the statement made without sufficient substantiation.",
        "Therefore, the Claim authenticity is": "False",
        "The information type is": "False",
        "The specific type of False Information is": "Text unsupported by the video."
