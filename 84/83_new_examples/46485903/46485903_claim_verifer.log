  "Claim": "On June 14, 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden said a new railroad was planned to be built across the Indian Ocean.",
  "Video_information": {'video_date': 20230615.0, 'platform': 'twitter', 'video_headline': 'BIDEN: "We have plans to build a railroad from the Pacific all the way across the Indian Ocean"', 'video_transcript': "We're gonna win and we're gonna help. We have plans to build a railroad from the Pacific all the way across the Indian Ocean. We have plans to build in in in in Angola, one of the largest solar plants in the world. I could go on, but I'm not. I'm going off script. I'm gonna get in trouble.", 'Video_descriptor': "The video opens with a man dressed in a formal suit and tie speaking into a microphone while positioned at a podium, which is set against a green backdrop adorned with a repeated pattern of the letters 'L' and 'C,' hinting at the involvement of an organization or event. He appears to be mid-speech, gesturing with his hands to emphasize his points, indicating that he is addressing an audience at what seems to be a formal gathering or conference. In a subsequent moment, another man joins him, and together they engage in conversation, both utilizing the microphone to project their voices. After this dialogue, the man in the suit rises from his seat, signaling an end to his participation, and walks away, leaving the focus on the ongoing event. The repeated visual cues of the 'L' and 'C' symbolize a connection to a broader theme, possibly networking or advocacy, although the video does not clarify the precise context or purpose of the gathering. Throughout, the setting reinforces the impression of an important formal event, likely related to political or social advocacy, emphasized by the presence of additional microphones and the decor surrounding the podium."},

  "Task": "Based on the content of the Video_information and the QA_CONTEXTS, accurately and rigorously determine whether the existing information is sufficient to judge the truthfulness of the claim. Can we determine the truthfulness of the claim based on the existing information? Please provide a reliability probability, clearly answer 'Yes' (the existing information is sufficient to determine the truthfulness) or 'No' (the existing information is insufficient to determine the truthfulness), and provide a detailed reason for your judgment. Include specific evidence from the provided information to support your conclusion. Answer 'Yes' only if the reliability probability is sufficiently high.",

The final output must be in valid JSON format, strictly adhering to the structure specified in the 'Output_Format' field. Provide a 'Yes' or 'No' judgment, a reliability probability ranging from 0% to 100%, and a detailed reason explaining your judgment with specific evidence. Ensure that the entire response is a properly formatted JSON object.

  "CVResult": {
    "Judgment": "Yes",
    "Confidence": "90%",
    "Reason": "The video information explicitly supports the claim that U.S. President Joe Biden mentioned plans to build a railroad across the Indian Ocean. The transcript states, 'We have plans to build a railroad from the Pacific all the way across the Indian Ocean' which directly matches the claim. Additionally, the context surrounding the speech, including the formal setting and the involvement of other individuals, indicates that this claim was made in an official capacity. While there may be nuances regarding the specific details of the railroad project that are not covered, the key assertion made by Biden is clearly presented, making the information sufficiently reliable to attribute truthfulness to the claim."
