And it does look, at first glance, like Biden was wearing that hard hat backwards’, Snopes . ‘But after comparing it to other photos and videos of the same event, we were forced to reach the opposite conclusion: the hat on Biden’s head was facing forward, bill to the front, not backward.’\nCiting Cooper Safety Supply’s ‘Hard Hat FAQ’, Snopes claimed the hat only _appeared_ to be on backwards. While Biden might have looked odd to non-experts, Snopes insisted that he was wearing the hat correctly all along. Our lying eyes had simply deceived us.\nAfter a barrage of complaints, Snopes  barely a day later. ‘It’s actually true that… Biden was wearing it backwards’, it clarified. ‘The strap and tightening knob, which should have been behind Biden’s head, were on his forehead.’ Which was precisely what most internet users were mocking Biden for in the first place.\n #### Video ### Starmer’s one-party state #### spiked]\nWhile the case of the backwards hard hat may be trivial in the grand scheme of things, Snopes’ willingness to dissemble on the president’s behalf speaks to a broader problem for journalism and ‘fact-checking’ in the Biden era.\nTellingly, around the time of Biden’s inauguration in 2021, the _Washington Post_ announced that it was closing its presidential fact-checking database. Similarly, Markos Moulitsas, co-founder of Vox Media, declared how ‘weird’ it was ‘not having to fact-check a presidential speech’ as Biden was being sworn in. After the turbulence of the Trump years, and with a supposedly safe pair of hands in the White House, there would apparently be no need to check if the new president’s claims were true.\nThose who pose as ‘fact-checkers’ today are often less interested in establishing the truth than in enforcing a particular narrative – or defending a particular politician. Indeed, as the Snopes hard-hat debacle shows us, much of the fact-checking media has turned into Joe Biden’s very own _Pravda_.\nWho will fact-check the fact-checkers?\n**Thomas Osborne** is an intern at _spiked_.\n ### Join our thriving donor community and enjoy exclusive perks, including: Ad-free reading Exclusive events Signed books Sign up now!]\n_Picture by: X._\n**To enquire about republishing _spiked_’s content, a right to reply or to request a correction, please contact the managing editor, .**\nShare\nTopics    \nTags        \n### Comments\n### Want to join the conversation?\n### Only _spiked_ supporters and patrons, who donate regularly to us, can comment on our articles.\n...[Content truncated]",

Only underpaid workers.  The problem is that their wages haven’t kept pace with their productivity.\nThe “paid what you’re worth” mythology also lures the unsuspecting into thinking nothing can be done to change what people are paid. It’s simply the way the market works.\nMeanwhile, according to this same view, CEOs who rake in tens of millions and Wall Street traders who rake in hundreds of millions, are simply being paid what they’re “worth” because that’s what the market has dictated.\nRubbish. The “paid what you’re worth” fairytale ignores power and disregards policies that have made inequality skyrocket. Like the demise of , which has given big corporations the power to set prices, , and reward their CEOs unprecedented . This fairytale ignores the attacks on labor unions that have reduced union membership from over  in the 1950s to .). All of this resulting in a massive shift in power and wealth from workers to owners.\nThose at the top justify their staggering wealth, and they’re “worth,” three ways:\nThe first is trickle-down economics. They claim that their wealth trickles down to everyone else as they invest it and create jobs. Just wait for it… But as we know, wealth at the top has soared for decades and .\nThe second is the “free market.” They talk about market forces beyond their control. But remember, markets are created by rules. These rules don’t exist in nature; they are human creations. The political power of the wealthy has let them change the rules for their own benefit — busting unions, monopolizing industries, and reaping big tax cuts.\nThe third is the idea that they’re superior human beings. Sure, they may be talented but this doesn’t justify the staggering amount of wealth they are now taking home. Nor does it justify the amount of wealth they will pass down to heirs. The biggest intergenerational transfer of wealth in history will occur over the  as the  hand down roughly some $36 trillion dollars to their children and grandchildren. That doesn’t make those heirs superior. It makes them lucky.\nThe reality is there’s no justification for today’s extraordinary concentration of wealth at the very top. Or for how little people are paid at the bottom.\nThe “paid what you’re worth” myth has proven to be a cruelly effective way to put the blame on workers for not getting ahead — while giving the rich and powerful cover to rig the game for their own benefit.\nIt is distorting our politics, rigging our markets...[Content truncated]",
