On the basis of that assumption, we originally rated the claim that Biden was wearing a hard hat backwards as false.\nThe prevailing counter-argument is that if the suspension of the hat has been purposely configured by its owner such that the bill and tightening knob are worn to the back (as was the case of the hat Biden wore), to wear that hat with the bill facing forward is, practically speaking, to wear it backwards. Therefore, it\u2019s argued, it\u2019s actually true that, in the photo op discussed below, Biden was wearing it backwards. The strap and tightening knob, which should have been behind Biden\u2019s head, were on his forehead.\nA corollary to that argument is \u201cBiden looks damn silly in any case.\u201d\nWe find these arguments sound. Therefore, the claim \u201cPresident Joe Biden wore a hard hat backwards during a photo op with union construction workers in Superior, Wisconsin\u201d is true, and this fact check has been re-rated as such. Thanks to all who argued on behalf of this correction.\nSo ultimately, the fact-checkers ruled that the obviously backward hat was backward after all, and that the photo of Biden wearing a hard hat backwards was indeed a photo of Biden wearing a hard hat backwards.

News Tips: pd1204@gmail.com.\n\n\nFox News Digital reports Biden was pictured during a visit to union workers in Wisconsin alongside Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. The photo clearly shows Biden wearing the hard hat backwards, with the strap and tightening knob clearly visible.\nSnopes' initial fact check, published Friday, attempted to explain the appearance.\n\n\nThe left-leaning political fact checker Snopes reversed one of its rulings this weekend to admit that President Biden did, in fact, wear a construction hard hat backwards. (Twitter @amyklobuchar)\nSocial media users blasted the determination, however, as hard hats universally have the tightening strap on the back. After weathering a storm on social media, Snopes offered an update reversing the fact check.\n\"The prevailing counter-argument is that if the suspension of the hat has been purposely configured by its owner such that the bill and tightening knob are worn to the back (as was the case of the hat Biden wore), to wear that hat with the bill facing forward is, practically speaking, to wear it backwards. Therefore, it's argued, it's actually true that, in the photo op discussed below, Biden was wearing it backwards. The strap and tightening knob, which should have been behind Biden's head, were on his forehead.\"\n\n\n\nPost a Comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
