And it does look, at first glance, like Biden was wearing that hard hat backwards\u2019, Snopes . \u2018But after comparing it to other photos and videos of the same event, we were forced to reach the opposite conclusion: the hat on Biden\u2019s head was facing forward, bill to the front, not backward.\u2019\nCiting Cooper Safety Supply\u2019s \u2018Hard Hat FAQ\u2019, Snopes claimed the hat only _appeared_ to be on backwards. While Biden might have looked odd to non-experts, Snopes insisted that he was wearing the hat correctly all along. Our lying eyes had simply deceived us.\nAfter a barrage of complaints, Snopes  barely a day later. \u2018It\u2019s actually true that\u2026 Biden was wearing it backwards\u2019, it clarified. \u2018The strap and tightening knob, which should have been behind Biden\u2019s head, were on his forehead.\u2019 Which was precisely what most internet users were mocking Biden for in the first place.\n #### Video ### Starmer\u2019s one-party state #### spiked]\nWhile the case of the backwards hard hat may be trivial in the grand scheme of things, Snopes\u2019 willingness to dissemble on the president\u2019s behalf speaks to a broader problem for journalism and \u2018fact-checking\u2019 in the Biden era.\nTellingly, around the time of Biden\u2019s inauguration in 2021, the _Washington Post_ announced that it was closing its presidential fact-checking database. Similarly, Markos Moulitsas, co-founder of Vox Media, declared how \u2018weird\u2019 it was \u2018not having to fact-check a presidential speech\u2019 as Biden was being sworn in. After the turbulence of the Trump years, and with a supposedly safe pair of hands in the White House, there would apparently be no need to check if the new president\u2019s claims were true.\nThose who pose as \u2018fact-checkers\u2019 today are often less interested in establishing the truth than in enforcing a particular narrative \u2013 or defending a particular politician. Indeed, as the Snopes hard-hat debacle shows us, much of the fact-checking media has turned into Joe Biden\u2019s very own _Pravda_.\nWho will fact-check the fact-checkers?\n**Thomas Osborne**\u00a0is an intern at\u00a0_spiked_.\n ### Join our thriving donor community and enjoy exclusive perks, including: Ad-free reading Exclusive events Signed books Sign up now!]\n_Picture by: X._\n**To enquire about republishing _spiked_\u2019s content, a right to reply or to request a correction, please contact the managing editor, .**\nShare\nTopics    \nTags        \n### Comments\n### Want to join the conversation?\n### Only _spiked_ supporters and patrons, who donate regularly to us, can comment on our articles.\n...[Content truncated]",

On the basis of that assumption, we originally rated the claim that Biden was wearing a hard hat backwards as false.\n, \n-----------------------------------------------------\n]\nAllSides Media Bias Rating: \n*   \n*   \n128592/95803  \nRelated Coverage\n----------------\nHEADLINE ROUNDUP\n Schumer Introduces Bill to Reverse SCOTUS Presidential Immunity Ruling]\nPERSPECTIVES BLOG\n President Joe Biden Drops Out of the Race]]\nFact Check\n Are undocumented immigrants housed at the most expensive hotels in New York City?]]\nFact Check\n]\n**Common Ground on Facts and Fact Checking**\n]\nSimilarity Hub is a project between AllSides and  that highlights survey data on topics on which Americans largely agree.

Therefore, it is highly relevant to confirming the claim's accuracy."

That they simply lack the skills they need to be paid more.\nBut there\u2019s no such thing as unskilled workers. Only underpaid workers.  The problem is that their wages haven\u2019t kept pace with their productivity.\nThe \u201cpaid what you\u2019re worth\u201d mythology also lures the unsuspecting into thinking nothing can be done to change what people are paid. It\u2019s simply the way the market works.\nMeanwhile, according to this same view, CEOs who rake in tens of millions and Wall Street traders who rake in hundreds of millions, are simply being paid what they\u2019re \u201cworth\u201d because that\u2019s what the market has dictated.\nRubbish. The \u201cpaid what you\u2019re worth\u201d fairytale ignores power and disregards policies that have made inequality skyrocket. Like the demise of , which has given big corporations the power to set prices, , and reward their CEOs unprecedented . This fairytale ignores the attacks on labor unions that have reduced union membership from over  in the 1950s to .). All of this resulting in a massive shift in power and wealth from workers to owners.\nThose at the top justify their staggering wealth, and they\u2019re \u201cworth,\u201d three ways:\nThe first is trickle-down economics. They claim that their wealth trickles down to everyone else as they invest it and create jobs. Just wait for it\u2026 But as we know, wealth at the top has soared for decades and .\nThe second is the \u201cfree market.\u201d They talk about market forces beyond their control. But remember, markets are created by rules. These rules don\u2019t exist in nature; they are human creations. The political power of the wealthy has let them change the rules for their own benefit \u2014 busting unions, monopolizing industries, and reaping big tax cuts.\nThe third is the idea that they\u2019re superior human beings. Sure, they may be talented but this doesn\u2019t justify the staggering amount of wealth they are now taking home. Nor does it justify the amount of wealth they will pass down to heirs. The biggest intergenerational transfer of wealth in history will occur over the  as the  hand down roughly some $36 trillion dollars to their children and grandchildren. That doesn\u2019t make those heirs superior. It makes them lucky.\nThe reality is there\u2019s no justification for today\u2019s extraordinary concentration of wealth at the very top. Or for how little people are paid at the bottom.\nThe \u201cpaid what you\u2019re worth\u201d myth has proven to be a cruelly effective way to put the blame on workers for not getting ahead \u2014 while giving the rich and powerful cover to rig the game for their own benefit.\nIt is distorting our politics, rigging our markets...[Content truncated]",
