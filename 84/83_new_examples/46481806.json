        "video_transcript": "",
        "Video_descriptor": "The video begins with a bird's eye view of the city's skyline, revealing various buildings against a backdrop of clear blue skies dotted with a few clouds. The camera then pans down to a scene where a statue stands proudly on a pedestal near a fountain, surrounded by greenery, but the tranquil image shifts dramatically as the camera captures a flooded area in which the water has begun to rise ominously. In this flooded landscape, a large building with classical columns, likely a governmental or institutional structure, looms in the background, partially submerged. The camera closely tracks a man as he walks through the inundated ground, his figure contrasted against the swirling floodwaters, showcasing the extent of the flooding that has just occurred. As he walks further into the scene, the floodwaters continue to encroach around him, emphasizing the storm's impact on the area. The video concludes with the man leaving the flooded area, highlighting a moment of solitude in an otherwise desolate and eerily quiet environment, punctuated by the stillness of the water and the absence of other people, creating a stark visual narrative of the aftermath of a sudden and severe flood event."
