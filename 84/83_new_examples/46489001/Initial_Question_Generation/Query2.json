                    "content": "Even beloved cartoon characters found themselves cast in unexpected roles in the midst of WWIl. Donald Duck, at the pinnacle of his Disney stardom, donned khakis and enlisted in the US Army while Mickey helped sell war bonds and  repurposed excess bacon grease to craft explosives.\nThe war provided a lifeline for Disney after a studio  and financial setbacks following _Fantasia_ and _Bambi_. Half of the Disney lot in Burbank, California, transformed into a military base to accommodate 500-700 soldiers, reportedly acting as an anti-aircraft protection unit for a nearby Lockheed aircraft plant but likely also overseeing production of military-related films.\nDisney had secured a $90,000 Navy contract to produce 20 training films, signaling a significant shift away from its usual entertainment-centric focus. Disney’s output soon surged with some films directed at soldiers, including the  series, while others appealed to a broader audience including .\n‍\n**Donald Duck: American Hero**‍\n-------------------------------\nDisney films also became cunning propaganda tools. _The New Spirit (1942)_ sees Donald Duck explaining why Americans should pay their “taxes to beat the Axis” while Disney’s Oscar-winning political satire _Der Fuehrer's Face_ (1943) imagines Donald as a German munitions factory worker dreaming about a better life in the US.\nAs with many propaganda films at the time, _Der Fuehrer's Face_ reflected the wartime 'us versus them' mentality, featuring a marching band of German military commanders and a racialized caricature of Japanese Prime Minister Tōjō Hideki. In the anti-Japanese propaganda film  _(1944),_ Donald parachutes into the jungle of a Pacific island to wipe out a Japanese airfield.\nThe stereotypes may make uncomfortable viewing decades later, which Disney acknowledged in an exhibition of its wartime propaganda: “Negative stereotypes of people and cultures, as well as other offensive imagery, were used as part of the United States’ propaganda efforts during World War II. We acknowledge its harmful impact and hope to encourage mindful discussion about misrepresentation and negative stereotypes, and use these lessons from the past to create a more inclusive future.”",

Fearing the worst, the British government issued 38 million gas masks to its population in anticipation of a possible gas attack during air raids. As the Nazis marched across Europe they invaded France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands with Holland and Belgium surrendering in May 1940. The Nazis bombed Paris as Norway surrendered and France fell to Germany. The potential attacks on Britain were real and looming. In August 1940, Nazi Germany launched a bombing offensive against airfields, factories and other strategic targets in Britain. The first air raids to hit central London began on August 23rd 1940.\n!British Government issued child’s gas mask. The design uses bright colors along with a floppy nose element that served only as a decorative devise to add character to the mask. It looked nothing like Mickey Mouse but was still referred as such to soothe the fear in children. Circa. 1940\nThe issuing of gas masks to every household in the country was a prudent act by the British government. They also designed a gas mask specifically for children which quickly became known as a “Mickey Mouse” gas mask. It looked nothing like Mickey Mouse but as it was explained in a note from the Disney London office: “The name was given to it by \\ Wardens and others who had the job of fitting them on small children, and the name Mickey Mouse was used to alleviate the fears of any these tiny tots who might be frightened at the sight of a gas mask.” The Disney note was relayed by T.S. Smith, the owner and General Manager of The Sun Rubber Company of Ohio, to...[Content truncated]",

As with all research, sometimes the most interesting, binge-worthy facts, are found falling down an enticing adjacent rabbit hole of information.\nSo far, the most interesting object I’ve researched is the World War 2 German gas mask. While it looks like a piece that came straight off the battlefield, it is actually an unused civilian gas mask. Despite civilians not having to use gas masks, the threat of nuclear war affected everyone, not only soldiers.!\nA picture I took of the Volk’s 40 gas mask in original packaging. _Property of the ROM Learning Dept._\nThese masks, known as “Volksgasmaske” or “people’s gas mask”, were part of a larger Nazi propaganda operation to make affordable goods for the German people, known as the \"people's products\".

To offset the resulting shortage, the government collected scrap from industry, agriculture, and civilian homes. In 1942, a peak of 24 million tons of metal was salvaged. Only slightly less was salvaged in each of the rest of the war years.\\\n ]\n“School children get in the scrap. The children are going into the field as a junior army engaged in a major campaign for victory. This picture shows scrap being dug out of an attic by the ‘junior commandos’.” Photo by Howard Liberman, Office of War Information, October 1942.Collection of the Library of Congress\nFamilies donated pots and pans, metal toys, broken tools and equipment. Some (including actress Rita Hayworth) removed metal fenders from their cars. Towns and cities (including ) sent historic cannons and monuments for salvage. Others salvaged metal fountains and wrought iron fences from cemeteries. In Rapides Parish, Louisiana the local sawmill added their scrap metal to the local school’s metal drive.\\ Storekeepers collected empty tin toothpaste and shaving cream tubes from customers before selling them a new one.\\\nAcross the country youth groups including the Girl Scouts of the USA organized regularly occurring can drives. They would collect the clean, crushed cans put out by householders and sell them for scrap as a fundraiser.\\ Even though processed foods were on the ration list, 90% of consumers still bought them. This meant that throughout the war, there was a regular supply of cans for salvage.\\\nRubber\n------\nRubber was critical to the war effort. The military needed it for gas masks, boots, tires, seals, pontoon bridges, and life rafts -- among other things. When Japan conquered Malaya and the Dutch East Indies early in 1942, they cut the US off from its primary source of natural rubber.\\ Rubber was so important that the head of the Army and Navy Munitions Board said that unless they had a good replacement, the US would have no option but to \"call the entire thing \\ off.\"\\\n ]\n“America Needs Your Scrap Rubber.” Poster, Bureau of Industrial Conservation, War Production Board, 1942.Collection of the National Archives and Records Administration (NAID: 513799).\nUS companies knew how to make synthetic rubber, but there wasn't enough manufacturing capacity.

It analyzes the impact of the war outbreak (as well as of other factors) on financial condition of the company and Disney’s cooperation with Canadian Government and political involvement in South American affairs. A detailed overview and description of several subgenres of cartoons that were produced for the needs of the government and US Army are also given. These were, for example, training films (popularly called “nuts ‘n’ bolt” films”), pure entertainment films as well as “motivation” films which were intended to encourage citizens to buy war bonds, pay taxes or save wastes. Apart from films itself the Burbank studio produced a whole range of other propaganda materials: from war insignia to Mickey Mouse gas masks. The article also contains some reflections on Walt Disney’s political attitude and preferences. Taking into consideration some of his pre-war films and their political meaning as well as producer’s contacts with Nazi Germany the author suggests that in the late 30’s and early 40’s Disney manifested a kind of a fascist inclination.\n### Downloads\nDownload data is not yet available.\n]\nPobrania\n--------\n*...[Content truncated]",
