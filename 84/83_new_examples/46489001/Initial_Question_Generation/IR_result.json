More than 40 million gas masks were issued. In America there was a gas mask for children that looked like Mickey Mouse, with the character's nose and ears and even a picture of him on the gas filter. Walt Disney helped in its design. This object is the British 'Mickey Mouse' gas mask. It did not resemble the cartoon character but it used the red and blue, like the American version and kept the name. It was given to children aged 18 months to 4 years old to allay their fears about wearing a respirator. It was also made lighter than normal masks so it was easier to wear.

Allison Meier for Atlas Obscura\nWith the brutal potential of World War II for chemical warfare on American soil, an intriguing approach was taken to get children to wear their terrifying gas masks. With the approval of Walt Disney himself, the Mickey Mouse gas mask was imagined in 1942.\nThe small mask with its Mickey ears was meant to put children at ease in an emergency situation (although the masks of the adults around them would probably still be nightmarish). As Major Robert D. Walk of the US Army Reserve Command explained : “The mask was designed so children would carry it and wear it as part of a game. This would reduce the fear associated with wearing a gas mask and hopefully, improve their wear time and, hence, survivability.”\nAbout 1,000 of them were made by the Sun Rubber Company, each with glass eyes staring out from the cartoonish face connected to an air filter. Since chemical warfare never made it to the United States in World War II, they weren’t used, but in England there was  that used bright red and blue colors to attract children. It was also called a “Mickey Mouse” gas mask, although had nothing to do with the character. Instead the name was supposed to be part of the “game” to get children to wear them.\nMost of the...[Content truncated]",

Fearing the worst, the British government issued 38 million gas masks to its population in anticipation of a possible gas attack during air raids. As the Nazis marched across Europe they invaded France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands with Holland and Belgium surrendering in May 1940. The Nazis bombed Paris as Norway surrendered and France fell to Germany. The potential attacks on Britain were real and looming. In August 1940, Nazi Germany launched a bombing offensive against airfields, factories and other strategic targets in Britain. The first air raids to hit central London began on August 23rd 1940.\n!British Government issued child’s gas mask. The design uses bright colors along with a floppy nose element that served only as a decorative devise to add character to the mask. It looked nothing like Mickey Mouse but was still referred as such to soothe the fear in children. Circa. 1940\nThe issuing of gas masks to every household in the country was a prudent act by the British government. They also designed a gas mask specifically for children which quickly became known as a “Mickey Mouse” gas mask. It looked nothing like Mickey Mouse but as it was explained in a note from the Disney London office: “The name was given to it by \\ Wardens and others who had the job of fitting them on small children, and the name Mickey Mouse was used to alleviate the fears of any these tiny tots who might be frightened at the sight of a gas mask.” The Disney note was relayed by T.S.

Fearing the worst, the British government issued 38 million gas masks to its population in anticipation of a possible gas attack during air raids. As the Nazis marched across Europe they invaded France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands with Holland and Belgium surrendering in May 1940. The Nazis bombed Paris as Norway surrendered and France fell to Germany. The potential attacks on Britain were real and looming. In August 1940, Nazi Germany launched a bombing offensive against airfields, factories and other strategic targets in Britain. The first air raids to hit central London began on August 23rd 1940.\n!British Government issued child’s gas mask. The design uses bright colors along with a floppy nose element that served only as a decorative devise to add character to the mask. It looked nothing like Mickey Mouse but was still referred as such to soothe the fear in children. Circa. 1940\nThe issuing of gas masks to every household in the country was a prudent act by the British government. They also designed a gas mask specifically for children which quickly became known as a “Mickey Mouse” gas mask. It looked nothing like Mickey Mouse but as it was explained in a note from the Disney London office: “The name was given to it by \\ Wardens and others who had the job of fitting them on small children, and the name Mickey Mouse was used to alleviate the fears of any these tiny tots who might be frightened at the sight of a gas mask.” The Disney note was relayed by T.S. Smith, the owner and General Manager of The Sun Rubber Company of Ohio, to...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "Is there credible evidence confirming that a Mickey Mouse gas mask was actually produced during World War II?",
        "Answer": "Yes, there is credible evidence confirming that a Mickey Mouse gas mask was produced during World War II. \n\n1. Walt Disney designed a gas mask that was shaped like Mickey Mouse to calm frightened children. Approximately 1,000 of these gas masks, known as Mickey Mouse respirators, were eventually produced during the early months of World War II. This was part of an effort to provide comfort to children at a time of fear over potential gas attacks.\n\n2. Additionally, a child-specific gas mask was designed by the British government during the war, which was commonly referred to as a \"Mickey Mouse\" gas mask. This name was used not because the mask resembled the character, but to help alleviate the fears of children when trying to fit them with these masks. The naming was a way to make the experience less intimidating for the young users.\n\nTaken together, these points provide strong evidence for the production of a Mickey Mouse gas mask during World War II, with legitimate design involvement from Walt Disney and usage of the name in context with children's gas masks.",
