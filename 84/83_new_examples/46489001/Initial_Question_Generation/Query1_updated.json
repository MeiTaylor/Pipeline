With large glass eyes, a snout and big, round ears, the mask was shaped like Disney's signature character: Mickey Mouse. It was meant to calm terrified children.\nAbout 1,000 Mickey Mouse respirators were eventually produced, but the civilian gas mask \u2014 for children or adults \u2014 was not really a notable presence on the home front during World War II.\nThings were different in England. In January 1943, a Washington Post reporter interviewed **Santosh Mahindra**, daughter of the head of the Indian Supply Mission. She had recently arrived in Washington from London, where she had been stranded since the start of the war.\nMiss Mahindra had her own burning question for the reporter: \u201cBut don\u2019t you...[Content truncated]",

More than 40 million gas masks were issued. In America there was a gas mask for children that looked like Mickey Mouse, with the character's nose and ears and even a picture of him on the gas filter. Walt Disney helped in its design. This object is the British 'Mickey Mouse' gas mask. It did not resemble the cartoon character but it used the red and blue, like the American version and kept the name. It was given to children aged 18 months to 4 years old to allay their fears about wearing a respirator. It was also made lighter than normal masks so it was easier to wear.
