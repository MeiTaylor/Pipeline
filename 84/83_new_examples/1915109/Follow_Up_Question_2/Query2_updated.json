Police on Thursday.\nThe video shows 30-year-old Chris Marquez attacked from behind as he was leaving a McDonald's on 911 E St., N.W., in Washington.\nMarquez was in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and received a bronze star for his heroism.\nAccording Marquez while he was eating at the McDonald's Friday night, a group of young people surrounded him and began yelling about \"black lives matter.\" Marquez says he sensed trouble and ignored them. When he left he was attacked and viciously beaten.\nMcDonald's says it turned the surveillance video over to police. On Wednesday there were reports that police may not release the video. This is what Metropolitan Police Assistant Chief Peter Newsham said Wednesday about the video.\n\"If there is evidence associated with the case we will get it out there and share it with the public. You know we have to look at for example with video in cases, the value and the chance that somebody may be able to identify a suspect from that, and once we are able to put that together, and we do have that we will share it.\"\nChris Marquez told ABC7 News detectives informed him Wednesday that the surveillance video from McDonald's is poor quality and likely will not be released. Since his attackers robbed him and used his credit cards, investigators are focused on those stores and are looking for video there.\nSURVEILLANCE VIDEO OF ATTACK:\nStay Connected\n Like Us]\n!\nFollow Us\nCookie Preferences...[Content truncated]",

He remembers being accosted at the McDonald's in Washington's Chinatown neighborhood by five people between 16 and 21 years old. Most were men or boys. One may have been female.\n\u201cThe kids were asking me if I think that black lives mattered,\u201d Marquez said on Monday. \u201cI was ignoring them, just because I felt intimidated. I felt how they approached me, it was very hostile. I felt they were really trying to intimidate me and just trying to start a confrontation with me.\u201d\nThe police report does not include a description of the people involved with the incident, which was first reported by\u00a0.
