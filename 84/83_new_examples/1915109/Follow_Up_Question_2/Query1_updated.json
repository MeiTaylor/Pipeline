We have witnessed humanity at its finest and at its ugliest. Citizens of faraway nations have expressed solidarity with black Americans; police officers have marched alongside protesters; protesters have defended businesses against looting and destruction. At the same time, rioters have burned down buildings and looted businesses; protesters have been pepper-sprayed and beaten; cops have been shot and run over with cars.\nAt the root of the unrest is the Black Lives Matter movement, which began with the acquittal of George Zimmerman in 2013 and rose to national prominence in the wake of Michael Brown\u2019s death in 2014. My view of BLM is mixed. On the one hand, I agree that police departments too often have tolerated and even enabled corruption. Rather than relying on impartial third parties, departments often decide whether to discipline their own officers; the legal doctrine of  sets what many say is an unreasonably high bar for civilians bringing civil-rights lawsuits against police officers. Bodycams (which increase transparency, to the benefit of both wrongly treated police suspects and wrongly accused police) are not yet universal. In the face of police unions that oppose even reasonable reforms, Black Lives Matter seems a force for positive change.\nOn the other hand, the basic premise of Black Lives Matter\u2014that racist cops are killing unarmed black people\u2014is false. There was a time when I believed it. I was one year younger than Trayvon Martin when he was killed in 201...[Content truncated]",

Until we learn to rise together and fight racial equity as a global unrelenting movement and stop falling for the divisive tactics of imperialist interests, we will never take our rightful place and value in this world as the powerful People God created us to be.\nI moved to the USA in 1996 as a student with idealistic views of the land of opportunities for all. I was mostly ignorant of US history from a black person\u2019s perspective because, despite being a walking encyclopedia like many of my peers who got their pre-university education on the continent, most of that knowledge came from history written by those same people that perpetrated imperialism, slavery, and colonization. We all know how that goes.\nDespite reading about the civil rights movement, I never suspected that the condition of blacks in America was still as bad as I discovered it to be years later. In college, I would challenge anyone who said \u201cthe system\u201d did this or that, because I didn\u2019t understand that notion; I was formatted to believe in the superficial equality the USA successfully projected. But I also and always believed that the call for Africa to Unite, from the mouths of African leaders like Kwame Nkrumah to the activism of Marcus Garvey and the tunes of Bob Marley, included the diaspora and thus black Americans.\nI did meet the ones who, just like the Africans today who are disconnected from the Black Lives Matter movement, would indignantly retort they were absolutely not from Africa; but I hope that both groups do realize that we are all we got, and while we call on other races\u2019 allyship, we must simultaneously ensure our internal connection as a people is unshakeable.\nWith time...[Content truncated]",

Yet, studies examining the long-term consequences of police contact with young people have not examined whether criminal justice consequences of police contact differ by race. We address this issue by examining whether police encounters with children and adolescents predict arrest in young adulthood and if these effects are the same for Black and White individuals. The paper uses longitudinal survey data from 331 Black and White respondents enrolled in the Seattle Public School District as eighth graders in 2001 and 2002. Our findings indicate that police encounters in childhood increase the risk of arrest in young adulthood for Black but not White respondents. Black respondents who experience contact with the police by the eighth grade have eleven times greater odds of being arrested when they are 20 years old than their White counterparts.\nPolice stops represent an entry point into the criminal justice system that, until recently, have received less scholarly attention than other stages of the criminal justice process. Recent research suggests that stops interpreted as harassing, unfair, or discriminatory damage public trust in police (Epp, Maynard-Moody, and Haider-Markel 2014; Fagan et al. 2010; Fagan and Tyler 2005; Meares 2014), encourage avoidance of police and other record-keeping institutions (e.g...[Content truncated]",

Blacks are killed at six times the rate of whites and Hispanics combined. In Los Angeles, blacks between the ages of 20 and 24 die at a rate 20 to 30 times the national mean. Who is killing them? Not the police, and not white civilians, but other blacks. The astronomical black death-by-homicide rate is a function of the black crime rate. Black males between the ages of 14 and 17 commit homicide at ten times the rate of white and Hispanic male teens combined. Blacks of all ages commit homicide at eight times the rate of whites and Hispanics combined, and at eleven times the rate of whites alone.\nThe police could end all lethal uses\u00a0of force tomorrow\u00a0and it would have at most a trivial effect on the black death-by-homicide rate. The nation\u2019s police killed 987 civilians in 2015, according to a database compiled by _The Washington Post_. Whites were 50 percent\u2014or 493\u2014of those victims, and blacks were 26 percent\u2014or 258. Most of those victims of police shootings, white and black, were armed or otherwise threatening the officer with potentially lethal force.\nThe black violent crime rate would actually predict that _more_ than 26 percent of police victims would be black. Officer use of force will occur where the police interact most often with violent criminals, armed suspects, and those resisting arrest, and that is in black neighborhoods. In America\u2019s 75 largest counties in 2009, for example, blacks constituted 62 percent of all robbery defendants, 57 percent of all murder defendants, 45 percent of all assault defendants\u2014but only 15 percent of the population.\nMoreover, 40 percent of all cop killers have been black over the last decade. And a larger proportion of white and Hispanic homicide deaths are a result of police killings than black homicide deaths\u2014but don\u2019t expect to hear that from the media or from the political enablers of the Black Lives Matter movement. Twelve percent of all white and Hispanic homicide victims are killed by police officers, compared to four percent of all black homicide victims. If we\u2019re going to have a \u201cLives Matter\u201d anti-police movement, it would be more appropriately named \u201cWhite and Hispanic Lives Matter.\u201d\nStandard anti-cop ideology, whether emanating from the ACLU or the academy, holds that law enforcement actions are racist if they don\u2019t mirror population data. New York City illustrates why that expectation is so misguided. Blacks make up 23 percent of New York City\u2019s population, but...[Content truncated]",

The suspect was later identified as Johnson. You can read our full coverage of the attack that .\nAs we reported, the gunman spoke about his motivations during the negotiations with authorities. Brown said:\n> \"The suspect said he was upset about Black Lives Matter. He said he was upset about the recent police shootings. The suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers. ...The suspect stated that he was not affiliated with any groups, and he did this alone.\"\nTwo law enforcement officials told NPR's Dina Temple-Raston that they believe the suspect had been planning an attack for some time and acted on his own. They added that they have not identified a connection between the suspect and any international terrorism or domestic extremist groups.\nJohnson had no criminal history, the Dallas Police Department said, and people interviewed during the investigation have identified him as a \"loner.\"\n\"During the search of the suspect's home, detectives found bomb making materials, ballistic vests, rifles, ammunition, and a personal journal of combat tactics,\" the police department said. It added: \"Detectives are in the process of analyzing the information contained in the journal.\"\nLaw enforcement officials have provided NPR with what they believe is Johnson's manifesto. As we reported, \"In the short purported manifesto, the writer points to police shootings of black Americans as his motivation and criticizes the Black Lives Matter movement.\"\n**'You Can't Bring Your Gun****'**\nThree weeks before Johnson opened fire in Dallas, he volunteered to provide security and help maintain order at a Dallas anti-Trump rally on June 16, reports .\nWhen the shooting suspect offered to help with the rally, Rev. Peter Johnson, a key organizer and long-known Dallas civil rights leader who marched with Martin Luther King Jr., and others, said no, because Micah Johnson wanted to bring his gun.\n\"Young man comes, says 'I'm going to participate, I want to help. But I want to bring my gun,' \" Rev. Johnson recalls. \"I say, \"Hell no, you can't bring your gun.' I told him you can't bring your gun to a protest that I'm involved in...[Content truncated]",

Pop stars like Lorde have publicly refused to perform in Tel Aviv as part of a boycott campaign against the occupation. During the 2019 Democratic presidential primary campaign, many of the candidates, including Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, publicly declined invitations to speak at the pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC\u2019s annual conference. This slow, if steady, trickle of awareness, has turned into a flood during this wave of violence.\nWhat does any of this have to do with Black Lives Matter? Black-Palestinian solidarity stretches back decades, and from the first days of Black Lives Matter, organizers have explicitly linked these two movements. Philosopher and activist Angela Davis has long acknowledged the deep links between the U.S. prison-industrial complex, racial violence, and Palestinian political incarceration. During the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after the police killing of Michael Brown in 2014, protesters held signs expressing solidarity with Palestinians and Palestinians took to social media to share instructions for how to treat tear gas.\nThe protests of last summer, spurred by the police killing of George Floyd pushed Black Lives Matter to the center of U.S. political discourse, transforming it from a controversial movement (in the eyes of some) to a mainstream political force that was impossible to ignore. Major corporations, celebrities, and universities that might have been silent before were proudly displaying their support for the phrase and the movement behind it.\nIn Palestine, too, George Floyd\u2019s killing had an impact on the relationship between these two movements. For example, George Floyd\u2019s image was painted on the separation barrier built around the occupied West Bank. After the fatal Israeli police killing of Eyad al-Hallaq, an unarmed Palestinian man, in Jerusalem, protesters in Palestine held up posters with al-Hallaq\u2019s image next to that of George Floyd\u2019s, bearing the slogan, \u201cFrom the USA to Palestine\u2026 Racism is a crime.\nThe conversation and following generated in this moment have persisted. Black Lives Matter\u2019s official Twitter handle has more than 1 million followers, and vocal activists around prison abolition and defunding the police also have followers numbering in the hundreds of thousands to millions. These same organizations and activists have come out to strongly support the Palestinian people in the face of oppression at the hands of the Israeli state. The official Black Lives Matter movement\u2014which even last summer was generating international solidarity uniting anti-racist movements across the world\u2014has amplified calls for the U.S. government to stop Israeli human rights abuses. Many of the activists who gained prominence over the past year have stated...[Content truncated]",
