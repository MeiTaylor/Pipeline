Officers arrived on scene and learned that a 30 year old male was suffering from two gunshot wounds to the face and shoulder area.\n \nThe preliminary investigation revealed that prior to the shooting; the residents of the household were in an altercation.\n \nOfficers secured the residence and both SAPD’s Criminal Investigations Division and Crime Scene Division arrived on scene to assist.\n \nTramarcia George (24 yoa) and Kyeshia Hornsby (28 yoa) were identified as suspects during the course of the investigation. The suspects were located in Shreveport, Louisiana and were transported and later booked into the Tom Green County Jail on 12/29/2022 for Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon.\n \nAdditional charges may be filed pending the outcome of this ongoing investigation.\n Between October 31- December 4th, San Angelo Police Department Criminal Investigations Division Northside and Southside Detectives began investigating several recent package thefts, during the holiday season. Video evidence and tips provided by the public indicated these crimes were being committed by the same person.   Thanks to persistence and teamwork, Detectives were able to arrest the suspect, 36-year-old Ethan Leonard, on multiple theft charges. \n Leonard was previously arrested for mail theft on December 9th.   This case is a great example of teamwork and communication from all of those involved.\nAdditional charges may be forthcoming pending the outcome of this ongoing investigation.\nThese are some of the still images captured by home surveillance cameras that were critical to the investigation. \nOn Monday, December 26th at 2:47 am San Angelo Police were dispatched to the 4200 block of Sunset Drive for a single car motor vehicle accident. \n \nUpon Officers arrival contact was made with the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle, identified as 48-year-old Cory Moore of SAPD.  Initial Officers then contacted an on duty SAPD supervisor and assistance was requested from the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS).\n \nAt the conclusion of the DWI investigation by Texas DPS, Moore was arrested for Driving While Intoxicated. \n \nMoore has been relieved of duty and placed on Administrative Assignment pending the outcome of the investigation. \n...[Content truncated]",

First, a hostile cyber operation does not \nhave to breach any particular obligation of a state. Thus, uncertainty about whether a hostile \ncyber operation breaches an obligation such as respect for sovereignty or refraining from inter -\nvention, or certainty that it does not, is no obstacle to acting based on necessity. \nSecond, in the proxy context, unlike in regards to countermeasures, it is unnecessary to \nlegally attribute the hostile cyber operation to a state before responding based on necessity. \nIndeed, there is no requirement to attribute the cyber operation to any particular entity at all. \nThe sole requirement is a factual determination that the cyber operation, irrespective of who \nmight have launched it, gravely threatens an essential interest of the targeted state, and the \nproposed response is the only feasible means to prevent or end the intrusion. \nFor instance, consider a proxy cyber operation targeting essential cyberinfrastructure, such \nas the national financial system, launched from a state to which attribution is suspected but \ncannot be established. Furthermore, the state might not be in breach of its due diligence ob -\nligation because it is uncertain whether it has the ability to put an end to the operation. The \ntargeted state’s proposed response would otherwise violate, at minimum, the territorial state’s \nsovereignty. Yet, in this situation, the unlawfulness of that response would be precluded so \nlong as the narrow criteria for the plea of necessity are satisfied. \nThe hostile cyber operation must be grave and imminent before the targeted state may re -\nspond. “Grave” denotes a threatened or ongoing hostile operation with consequences that are \nexceptionally severe, detrimental, or have an otherwise acute impact on an essential interest of \nthe state. A proxy’s operation that targets an essential interest with only a limited effect would \nfall short of this standard. “Imminent” indicates that a targeted state is allowed to respond an -\nticipatorily. Imminence is not to be understood in terms of time. Rather, a threat is imminent \nwhere failure to respond would deprive the state of the opportunity to prevent or stop the \nproxy’s hostile cyber operation effectively.  \nIn addition, an essential interest must be affected. Unfortunately, international law does not \ndefine the term. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 experts describe it as an interest “that is of a funda -\nmental and great importance to the State concerned.”  Certain areas of activity are clearly \nessential to all states. Paradigmatic examples include national economic well-being, public \nhealth and safety, communications, power generation,...[Content truncated]",
