Tritten\nTravis J. Tritten\nStars and Stripes • February 23, 2016\n* * *\n! \nSgt. Chris Marquez, left, and Cpl. Dane Shaffer, two of the three Marines the \"Hell House\" statue is based on, help unveil the new monument at the Warrior Hope and Care Center at Camp Lejeune, March 8, 2013. (U.S. Marines)\nWASHINGTON — Police made two arrests Monday following the assault earlier this month of a decorated Marine outside a fast-food restaurant in Washington, D.C.\nA 17-year-old male was charged with aggravated assault and a 17-year-old female was charged with robbery. Both are from Washington and were not named by police due to their age.\nA third person was suspected in the Feb. 12 attack, which victim Christopher Marquez said was racially motivated. Police said the investigation is continuing.\n“The kids were asking me if I think that black lives mattered,” Marquez told USA Today this month. “I was ignoring them, just because I felt intimidated. I felt how they approached me, it was very hostile. I felt they were really trying to intimidate me and just trying to start a confrontation with me.”\nA surveillance video released by police last week shows a black male assailant in a white tank top punch Marquez in the head from behind as Marquez walked out of a McDonald’s on E Street across from FBI headquarters, according to police.\nMarquez, 30, is a Bronze Star with “V” device recipient who fought in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2004 and served until 2011.\nAfter being punched, Marquez fell to the ground where he was robbed by the female suspect and then kicked in the head, police said.\nMarquez was one of three Marines in an iconic photo taken during the second battle of Fallujah. He was photographed carrying a fellow Marine whose uniform is blood-soaked from a wound during the so-called Hell House battle during which one Marine was killed and 10 were wounded.\n _Twitter: _\nstripes Administrator\nstripes Administrator\n### Subscribe to Stars and Stripes\nJust 99c a week! \n* * *\nstars and stripes videos\n------------------------\n* * *\naround the web\n--------------\n* * *\nstripes top news\n----------------\n]\n### \n]\n...[Content truncated]",

One can only hope that he continues telling tales for many years to come.\n!\nGeorge Orwell’s _Animal Farm_ is famous for the quote “Some animals are more equal than others.” Someone should write an update called _American Farm_ that includes the line _“Some hate crimes are more equal than others”_ after the Washington, D.C., attack of war hero Christopher Marquez.\nMost media outlets have not covered the Feb. 12 attack of Marquez, who served eight years on active duty between 2003 and 2011. In short, the Bronze Star recipient sat down to eat in a McDonald’s in the nation’s capital and was accosted by a group of teens demanding to know if he thought “black lives matter.”\nLike most sane people, he tried to ignore them and just eat his burger. _He was promptly ambushed and robbed upon exiting the restaurant._\n“I believe this was a hate crime and I was targeted because of my skin color,” Marquez told the  Feb. 15. “Too many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the mainstream media refuses to report on it.”\n!\nSuspects arrested in connection with Christopher Marquez’s assault and robbery will not be charged with a hate crime, despite harassing him with racial questions prior to their attack. (Photo: D.C. Metropolitan Police Department)\nThere are two very interesting facts about Marquez’s case:\n1.  Cops finally arrested and charge two individuals in connection with the incident, but _they  — even though they were explicitly harassing him about race and calling him “racist” before the attack._\n2.  President Obama, who always seems eager to weigh in on race-related crimes, _somehow can’t find his voice when it comes to Black Lives Matter supporters who beat a Marine veteran unconscious and stole $400, a VA medical card, and three credit cards from his back pocket just miles from the White House._ What did his assailants spend the stolen cash on, you ask? Answer: liquor, a Five Guys burgers, and products from Walmart.\nRegular readers of this blog may remember the case of , who was attacked by a similar group of kids on the DC Metro Green Line in 2011. They may also remember  on the Green Line from September 17, 2011.\nI wrote then:\n> As I came home late from work on the D.C. Metro Green line, an inebriated older man...[Content truncated]",

In the plea agreement and in open court, Marquez admitted that he conspired with Syed Rizwan Farook in 2011 and 2012 to attack Riverside City College (RCC) and commuter traffic on the 91 Freeway.\nMarquez also pleaded guilty to making false statements in connection with the acquisition of firearms, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922 (a)(6), by serving as the “straw buyer” of two assault rifles that he provided to Farook. More than three years later, Farook and his wife used those rifles in the shooting rampage at the San Bernardino Inland Regional Center (IRC) on Dec. 2, 2015. Hours later, both Farook and his wife were killed by law enforcement, ending what at the time was the worst terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11.\nThe investigation into the deadly shooting at the IRC quickly uncovered evidence that, in 2011 and 2012, Marquez purchased two rifles that Farook and his wife used in the IRC attack. According to Marquez’s plea agreement, Farook paid Marquez for the rifles. Marquez also discussed with Farook the use of radio-controlled improvised explosive devices (IEDs) during the planned attacks on RCC and State Route 91. Marquez admitted purchasing Christmas tree lightbulbs and a container of smokeless powder for use in manufacturing IEDs.\nProsecutors argued in a sentencing memorandum filed last week that Marquez “was a full, willing, and motivated participant of the conspiracy who not only provided the agreement necessary for the conspiracy to attack RCC and SR...[Content truncated]",

This is also likely to be the case in future attacks. In both cases, the local law enforcement response required judgment calls in extremely volatile and difficult circumstances. While well-defined, well-developed, and practiced protocols equipped responding officers to perform effectively during these tragic events, vital lessons have also been learned, including how to confront attackers armed or claiming to be armed with high-powered weapons and explosive devices. Some traditional practices need to be realigned and enhanced to improve the survivability of victims and the safety of first responders in an increasingly complicated threat environment.\nDuring the last decade, individuals motivated by a range of ideological beliefs and individual factors have engaged in horrific acts of mass violence targeting innocent civilians in communities across the United States. These attacks, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service in 2015, have increased in frequency as well as lethality.1 This new reality has challenged law enforcement agencies to ensure their training, tactics, and operational procedures evolve effectively in order to confront offenders who kill and seriously injure defenseless civilians at movie theaters,a schools,b churches,c conference rooms,d nightclubs,e and iconic sporting eventsf as well as in mobile active shootings throughout a community.g\nThis articleh focuses on the local law enforcement response to...[Content truncated]",

Quan and the attempted murder of her boyfriend, Ryan T. Waller. He faces the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison when he is sentenced by Judge Susanna Pineda on January 25, 2013. Carver’s son and accomplice in the crimes, Richie Lee Carver, was previously convicted and sentenced in 2008 to natural life in prison.\n“Today’s verdict is a long awaited milestone on what has been a tortuous and difficult road to justice for the victims of this terrible crime, requiring an extraordinary detour through our state legislature,” said Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery. “We now await the imposition of a sentence that will appropriately hold this defendant accountable for his criminal actions,” he added.\nOn December 23, 2006, Larry Carver and his son, Richie, went to Ryan Waller’s house seeking revenge for a presumed altercation. While the Carvers attempted to force their way through the doorway of the residence, Richie Carver put his arm inside and shot Mr. Waller in the head, leaving him for dead. The Carvers then entered the residence and shot and killed Heather Quan, apparently because she was a witness. They also stole several weapons and a computer from the scene.\nWhen officers from the Phoenix Police Department arrived, they found Waller still conscious. He was able to identify the assailants and was taken to the hospital, where he had part of his brain removed and lost his left eye as a result of the gunshot wound. Detectives later learned that Richie Carver was a former roommate of Waller’s.\nRichie Carver was convicted in June, 2008 of Felony Murder, Burglary, Aggravated Assault and Misconduct Involving Weapons and sentenced to a term of natural life. The case against Larry Carver was based in part on confessions he made to his wife and was ultimately dismissed after she invoked her marital privilege and refused to testify against her husband.\nThe family of Heather Quan then appealed to the legislature to enact what became known as “Heather’s Law,” which amended the marital privilege statute to compel a defendant’s spouse to testify. After a legal battle over whether the law could apply retroactively to Larry Carver’s case, the Court ruled in favor of the State and Carver was reindicted in November...[Content truncated]",

This document focuses on introducing what is known about the problem space; a separate but related effort is needed to document the state of knowledge on potential interventions. We begin with an overview of the state of knowledge on “individual factors,” that is, the characteristics that may increase the risk of victimization or perpetration. We then turn to research on “contextual factors,” that is, any attribute, condition, or state that is shared across members of a group and that may enable or constrain the likelihood of sexual misconduct. Where appropriate, we include recommendations on how to advance each area of research, providing examples whenever possible. v\nThe scope of the review is bound in several ways. Firstly, since the focus is on active duty service members, we devote comparatively less attention to research on sexual misconduct in the National Guard and Reserve components, as well as among government civilians. While these are important areas of research, they are beyond the current focus. Secondly, to help contextualize information about sexual misconduct in the military, we incorporate research on non-military populations whenever possible. Third, we do not limit the scope of the literature review to a set period of time. Academic disciplines vary widely when it comes to determining what time frame counts as relevant. Rather than engaging in disciplinary contests, each expert on the team focused on selecting the most prominent and rigorous studies from their respective fields. The requirements for inclusion were that findings were (1) evidence based and (2) offered insights that were plausibly still relevant. Throughout, we offer a critical perspective on previous research, in the sense that study findings are presented alongside important limitations. The intent is not to dismiss previous work—since every study has limitations—but rather to help readers understand the interpretive boundaries of researchers’ claims. \n# Summary of Findings \nWho is at risk of victimization? \nResearchers have identified several factors that may put some individuals at greater risk of experiencing sexual misconduct than others. In the military, the risk of victimization appears to be higher if one is a gender minority or serves in the enlisted grades. The risk of experiencing sexual misconduct is also significantly higher in the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps than in the Air Force. \nResearch on non-military populations has identified several additional factors that may increase someone’s risk of victimization, including being a racial or ethnic minority, being economically disadvantaged, being a sexual minority, and having some type of disability. \nWho is at risk of perpetration? \nResearch on both military and non-military populations shows that perpetrators of both sexual assault and sexual harassment are more likely to be male than female....[Content truncated]",
