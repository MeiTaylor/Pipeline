He was photographed carrying a fellow Marine whose uniform is blood-soaked from a wound during the so-called Hell House battle during which one Marine was killed and 10 were wounded.\ntritten.travis@stripes.com Twitter: @Travis_Tritten\n\nSign up to receive a daily email of today's top military news stories from Stars and Stripes and top news outlets\n      from around the world.\n\nSign Up Now ",

(U.S. Marines)\n\t\t\t\nWASHINGTON — Police made two arrests Monday following the assault earlier this month of a decorated Marine outside a fast-food restaurant in Washington, D.C.\n A 17-year-old male was charged with aggravated assault and a 17-year-old female was charged with robbery. Both are from Washington and were not named by police due to their age.\n A third person was suspected in the Feb. 12 attack, which victim Christopher Marquez said was racially motivated.

I felt they were really trying to intimidate me and just trying to start a confrontation with me.”\n A surveillance video released by police last week shows a black male assailant in a white tank top punch Marquez in the head from behind as Marquez walked out of a McDonald’s on E Street across from FBI headquarters, according to police.\n Marquez, 30, is a Bronze Star with “V” device recipient who fought in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2004 and served until 2011.\n After being punched, Marquez fell to the ground where he was robbed by the female suspect and then kicked in the head, police said.\n Marquez was one of three Marines in an iconic photo taken during the second battle of Fallujah. He was photographed carrying a fellow Marine whose uniform is blood-soaked from a wound during the so-called Hell House battle during which one Marine was killed and 10 were wounded.\ntritten.travis@stripes.com Twitter: @Travis_Tritten\n\nSign up to receive a daily email of today's top military news stories from Stars and Stripes and top news outlets\n      from around the world.\n\nSign Up Now "

        "Question": "Is there any corroborating evidence or eyewitness accounts of Christopher Marquez being assaulted by activists?",
        "Answer": "Yes, there is corroborating evidence and eyewitness accounts regarding Christopher Marquez being assaulted, but there are also questions surrounding the motivations behind the attack.\n\n1. According to reports, Christopher Marquez stated that he was assaulted by a group of young individuals who questioned him about whether \"black lives mattered.\" He described feeling intimidated and suggested that the encounter was hostile, indicating he believed it was racially motivated [Query2_evidence_2].\n\n2. The Metropolitan Police Department confirmed that there were at least four individuals involved in the attack, and they are seeking suspects in connection to the incident. Marquez's account mentions that he was attacked by a group of young males and females, which corroborates the idea that multiple people were involved [Query2_evidence_1].\n\n3. Following the assault, police arrested two individuals, including a 17-year-old male and a female, who were charged with aggravated assault and robbery, respectively. They were considered suspects of the February 12 attack, confirming that the police recognized the incident as serious enough to warrant arrests [Query2_evidence_3].\n\n4. However, it is important to note that local police maintained they could not verify the specific identities or motivations of the individuals involved, and they stated that there was no conclusive evidence tying the suspects to the Black Lives Matter movement, which adds complexity to the narrative around the motivation behind the assault [Query2_evidence_2].\n\nBased on the analysis of this evidence and the contradictions regarding the motivations, I would rate my confidence in the answer as 75%.",
