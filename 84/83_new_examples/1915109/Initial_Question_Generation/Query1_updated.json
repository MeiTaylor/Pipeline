President Obama, who always seems eager to weigh in on race-related crimes, _somehow can\u2019t find his voice when it comes to Black Lives Matter supporters who beat a Marine veteran unconscious and stole $400, a VA medical card, and three credit cards from his back pocket just miles from the White House._ What did his assailants spend the stolen cash on, you ask? Answer: liquor, a Five Guys burgers, and products from Walmart.\nRegular readers of this blog may remember the case of , who was attacked by a similar group of kids on the DC Metro Green Line in 2011. They may also remember  on the Green Line from September 17, 2011.\nI wrote then:\n> As I came home late from work on the D.C. Metro Green line, an inebriated older man...[Content truncated]",
