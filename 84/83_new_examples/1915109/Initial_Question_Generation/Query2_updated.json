One may have been female.\n\"The kids were asking me if I think that black lives mattered,\" Marquez said on Monday. \"I was ignoring them, just because I felt intimidated.

It's considered fairly reliable but has faced criticism for sensationalism in some cases. They have a fact-checking team but can occasionally fall into the trap of clickbait headlines, which affects their credibility slightly."

McDonald\u2019s, leaving him in the restaurant unconscious.\nChristopher Marquez, 30, an Iraq War vet, told the Washington Post he was eating in a back corner of the restaurant on Friday when a group of teens and young men approached his table.\n\"They saw me and crowded around ... and they started asking me if I believed black lives matter,\u201d Marquez told the paper. \u201cI was ignoring them, then they started calling me racist.\"\nAt that point, Marquez said he left the McDonald's, but was knocked unconscious by a blow to his head. When he came to, his pants were ripped and his wallet, which contained $400 in cash, three credit cards and VA medical card among other items, was missing.\nDeAnthony Mason, manager of the McDonald\u2019s, reviewed security footage and told Marquez that he was hit on the side of the head before the other teens converged on his body to take his belongings, The Daily Caller reports.\nCredit card transactions reviewed by The Daily Caller revealed that Marquez\u2019s cards later were charged more than $115 at a liquor store, Five Guys and a Walmart.\nThe teens involved in the attack were being sought by police for a previous incident, Mason said, according to Marquez.\nBut the D.C. Metropolitan Police told FoxNews.com Wednesday that they are still working to identify the four people in the video.\nAccording to the Daily Caller, which first reported the incident, Marquez was able to take a cab back to his apartment, where building employees called police. He was treated at George Washington University Hospital for head trauma.\nMarquez served in the Marine Corps from 2003 to 2011.

Dane Shaffer, two of the three Marines the \"Hell House\" statue is based on, help unveil the new monument at the Warrior Hope and Care Center at Camp Lejeune, March 8, 2013. (U.S. Marines)\n\t\t\t\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Police made two arrests Monday following the assault earlier this month of a decorated Marine outside a fast-food restaurant in Washington, D.C.\n A 17-year-old male was charged with aggravated assault and a 17-year-old female was charged with robbery. Both are from Washington and were not named by police due to their age.\n A third person was suspected in the Feb. 12 attack, which victim Christopher Marquez said was racially motivated. Police said the investigation is continuing.\n \u201cThe kids were asking me if I think that black lives mattered,\u201d Marquez told USA Today this month. \u201cI was ignoring them, just because I felt intimidated. I felt how they approached me, it was very hostile. I felt they were really trying to intimidate me and just trying to start a confrontation with me.\u201d\n A surveillance video released by police last week shows a black male assailant in a white tank top punch Marquez in the head from behind as Marquez walked out of a McDonald\u2019s on E Street across from FBI headquarters, according to police.\n Marquez, 30, is a Bronze Star with \u201cV\u201d device recipient who fought in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2004 and served until 2011.\n After being punched, Marquez fell to the ground where he was robbed by the female suspect and then kicked in the head, police said.\n Marquez was one of three Marines in an iconic photo taken during the second battle of Fallujah. He was photographed carrying a fellow Marine whose uniform is blood-soaked from a wound during the so-called Hell House battle during which one Marine was killed and 10 were wounded.\ntritten.travis@stripes.com Twitter: @Travis_Tritten\n\nSign up to receive a daily email of today's top military news stories from Stars and Stripes and top news outlets\n      from around the world.\n\nSign Up Now ",
