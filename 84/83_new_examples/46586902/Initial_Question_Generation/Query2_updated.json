In fact, they\u00a0typically survive for only about ten minutes in the open air.\nWhen a similar clip , nemertean specialist Dr Sebastian Kvist, who is also an associate curator of\u00a0invertebrates at Royal Ontario Museum, noted that the animals sometimes\u00a0fall\u00a0apart if\u00a0handled. When this happens, the severed pieces can continue wriggling around like\u00a0animated copies of a parent worm.\nWe checked in with\u00a0Kvist about this more recent encounter, and he confirmed that the ribbon worm in the video was in very bad shape.\u00a0\"My best guess is that the worm is dying and that's why it's breaking apart,\" he explained.\nThere isn't much information about where the sighting was filmed, but we suspect\u00a0that the worm belongs to the genus\u00a0_\")_. Out of the 1,000 or more known species of ribbon worms, only a handful possess a branching proboscis like this one.\nThe fleshy tube is an infolding of the body wall that can evert like the \u00a0\u2013 and\u00a0if you watch the footage closely, you'll notice that the worm actually discards it.\n\"The reason for the expelling of the proboscis is that the worm thinks that it is attacked,\" said\u00a0Kvist. \"It's trying to leave the proboscis behind for the predator so that it can escape \u2013 it's trying everything to stay alive.\"\nKvist adds that while some nemerteans can regenerate lost body parts like earthworms, no records of that remarkable ability exist for this species.\u00a0So even if the ribbon worm somehow\u00a0stayed alive long enough to be returned to the sea, it would no longer have been able to hunt.\nIt seems very unlikely that the unfortunate creature\u00a0ended up on a dry rock by natural\u00a0means.\u00a0Most ribbon worms live on the sea floor, and many hide out beneath shells and amongst mussel beds. This choice of habitat leaves the animals particularly vulnerable to accidental catch.\nShould you be lucky enough to spot one of these rarely seen worms in the wild, resist the urge to handle it. And if you happen to find one lurking in your shellfish catch, always release it\u00a0as soon as possible.\n]\n\\_\\_\nTop header image: \n]\nEarth Touch News\n#### Sarah Keartes\nSarah Keartes is a science and wildlife journalist based in the Pacific Northwest....[Content truncated]",

Within that world, the strange creatures of the ocean are often the most alien.\nAdvertisement\nA video of a truly bizarre marine worm who appears to be puking its guts out\u00a0has surfaced on the Internet, intriguing (and sometimes grossing out) the masses.\nThe creature looks like it's a proboscis or ribbon worm, Kyle Hill of Nerdist explains\u00a0\u2014 a Google translation of the  from Thai to English seems to indicate the same.\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers.\u0014  and start reading now.

Seriously, that growing rootlike structure that's vomited out is designed to drag food inside. Crab, fish, snails, other worms \u2014 anything will do (depending on the type and size of the ribbon worm we are talking about).\nUntil the worm needs to eat, the proboscis stays in a sac on top of the worm's gut.\nAdvertisement\nBut once the worm senses prey approaching, its muscles contract quickly, forcing fluid into the sheath and the proboscis out into the world through a pore in the worm's head.\nThe proboscis then grabs what's for lunch and drags it into the worm's belly.\nTalk about crazy ways to eat.\nHill describes the proboscis as \"like having a rubber glove inside your face that you could force outwards by blowing into it.\"\nAdvertisement\nAs fascinatingly weird as that is...[Content truncated]",

Watch it now.\n(Editor's note: This post references a video that is no longer available. We've updated it with a similar video of a ribbon worm.)\nNow that you're up to speed, you\u2019re probably wondering what\u2019s going on here.\nTo learn more, mental_floss\u00a0spoke to biologist Sebastian Kvist, associate curator of invertebrates at the Royal Ontario Museum, where he specializes in Nemertea, the phylum of ribbon worms this creature belongs to.\nThe upshot: This animal is weird, rare, and mysterious\u2014even to scientists. The invertebrate is likely from the genus Gorgonorhyncus, which lives in shallow marine waters. That milky goo is actually the worm\u2019s hunting gear: a very rare branching proboscis that this aggressive predator shoots out from a specialized port to net prey, including mollusks, snails, and even other sea worms. It then drags the captured prey into its mouth and swallows it whole.\nThe worm also throws out its proboscis as a defensive strategy\u2014and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in the video, Kvist says. The worm tries to defend itself by casting out the proboscis, which splatters against the man...[Content truncated]",

One such video capturing a remarkable creature, the ribbon worm, has recently gone viral.

Remarkably, ribbon worms can capture and eat prey up to three times their own size.\nA popular X account shared the video of the ribbon worm shooting its proboscis. So far, this clip has over three lakh views.\n> Probably one of the most 'alien-like' species, the ribbon worm spits a living, tree-like proboscis to hunt it prey\u2014 Massimo (@Rainmaker1973) \nIn the comments, many people expressed awe as well the feelings of fear and disgust towards the strange-looking worm.
