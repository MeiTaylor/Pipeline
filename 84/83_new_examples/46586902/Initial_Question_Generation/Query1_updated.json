Although many different kinds of animals are commonly lumped together as \u201cworms,\u201d there are several distinct phyla that fit the category. Worms are typically long, thin creatures that get around efficiently without legs. The different phyla of worms display a great range in size, complexity, and body structure. Flatworms (phylum Platyhelminthes) are simple animals that are slightly more complex than a cnidarian. Roundworms (phylum Nematoda) have a slightly more complex body plan. Segmented worms (phylum Annelida) are the most complex animals with worm-like body plans. A study of worms can illuminate a possible history of how some organ systems and body features evolved.\n**Fig. 3.35.** (**A**) A whale shark (_Rhincodon typus_; a vertebrate animal)\nImage courtesy of Tanaka Juuyoh, \n**Fig. 3.35.**\u00a0(**B**) A swimming polychaete worm (_Tomopteris_ sp.; an invertebrate animal in the phylum Annelida)\n* * *\nWorms are invertebrate animals with bilateral symmetry. Worms have a definite anterior (head) end and a posterior (tail) end. The **ventral** surface of worms and other organisms is the bottom side of the body, often closest to the ground. The **dorsal** surface is located on the upper part of the body facing the sky. The **lateral** surfaces are found on the left and right sides of the body.

Nemertea is distinguished by an eversible muscular proboscis, and most of the species are venomous. Genomic resources for this phylum are scarce despite their value in understanding biodiversity. Here, we present genome size estimates of Nemertea based on flow cytometry and their relationship to different morphological and developmental traits. Ancestral genome size estimations were done across the nemertean phylogeny. The results increase the available genome size estimates for Nemertea three-fold. Our analyses show that Nemertea has a narrow genome size range (0.43\u20133.89 pg) compared to other phyla in Lophotrochozoa. A relationship between genome size and evolutionary rate, developmental modes, and habitat was found. Trait analyses show that the highest evolutionary rate of genome size is found in upper intertidal, viviparous species with direct development. Despite previous findings, body size in nemerteans was not correlated with genome size. A relatively small genome (1.18 pg) is assumed for the most recent common ancestor of all extant nemerteans. The results provide an important basis for future studies in nemertean genomics, which will be instrumental to understanding the evolution of this enigmatic and often neglected phylum.\n**...[Content truncated]",

Some worms stick feathery external gills up into the water where there is more oxygen, and others pump water into their burrows to bring oxygen down to them  Some worms have blood just like ours that can store oxygen, which gives them their red color.\n  fireworm  According to Frontiers: Just like the earthworms in a garden that eat dirt, many worms on the ocean floor eat sediment. Some of the best worm food on the ocean floor comes from dead plankton, fish poop, and other goo produced by organisms in the water that sinks to the sediment surface creating detritus. Worms have special guts with a kind of soap that helps them digest the detritus that coats the sand grains. However, marine worms do not eat just detritus\u2014some of them are carnivores or scavengers, some are herbivores, and some are parasites. Some worms have teeth, jaws, or even venomous fangs for capturing prey or grazing on plants. Some vegetarian worms scrape algae from rocks with special teeth. Compared to the earthworms in a garden, worms in the ocean have evolved a spectacular variety of body parts used to find, grab, and hold onto food.  [Source:  Kara J. Gadeken, Erin Kiskaddon, Jenna M. Moore, Kelly M. Dorgan Frontiers, November 14, 2022]\nMany animals like to eat worms, so worms have evolved numerous ways to avoid predators. Worms that swim in the water or crawl around on the seafloor surface are more exposed, so they often have venomous or irritating spines or use stinky or poisonous chemicals to be less tasty. Some worms hide from predators by building burrows or tubes in sediment. To resist getting pulled or sucked out of their homes, worms use stiff hairs on their bodies to hold onto their tubes or burrows. It is common to find worms that are growing back their tails or even their heads after having those parts bitten off by a passing fish!\nIn terms of reproduction, Some worms just throw their eggs and sperm into the water, but others turn their tails into a zombie mini-worm that carries eggs or sperm, complete with a new head and eyes. Sometimes worms keep their babies inside or on their bodies or inside their burrows until they are almost grown up. Sometimes worms can clone themselves by splitting in half and regrowing a new head and tail.\nMost marine worms \u2014 and most worms period \u2014 as we said before belong...[Content truncated]",
