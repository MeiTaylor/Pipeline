They are characterized by an eversible proboscis that is used to hunt for prey and thick mucus covering their skin. Both proboscis and epidermal mucus mediate toxicity to predators and preys. Research into the chemical nature of the substances that render toxicity has not been extensive, but it has nevertheless led to the identification of several compounds of potential medicinal use or for application in biotechnology. This review provides a complete account of the current status of research into nemertean toxins.\n**Keywords:** Anabaseine, cytotoxin, DMXBA, nemertea, nemertide, parborlysin, ribbon worm, tetrodotoxin\n1\\.

One such video capturing a remarkable creature, the ribbon worm, has recently gone viral. The undated footage shows a slimy ribbon worm crawling across a man’s hand and extending a tree-like structure known as a proboscis. This proboscis is used by the ribbon worm to ensnare its prey, which it then pulls towards its mouth and consumes whole. Remarkably, ribbon worms can capture and eat prey up to three times their own size.\nA popular X account shared the video of the ribbon worm shooting its proboscis. So far, this clip has over three lakh views.\n> Probably one of the most 'alien-like' species, the ribbon worm spits a living, tree-like proboscis to hunt it prey— Massimo (@Rainmaker1973) \nIn the comments, many people expressed awe as well the feelings of fear and disgust towards the strange-looking worm.

In fact, they typically survive for only about ten minutes in the open air.\nWhen a similar clip , nemertean specialist Dr Sebastian Kvist, who is also an associate curator of invertebrates at Royal Ontario Museum, noted that the animals sometimes fall apart if handled. When this happens, the severed pieces can continue wriggling around like animated copies of a parent worm.\nWe checked in with Kvist about this more recent encounter, and he confirmed that the ribbon worm in the video was in very bad shape. \"My best guess is that the worm is dying and that's why it's breaking apart,\" he explained.\nThere isn't much information about where the sighting was filmed, but we suspect that the worm belongs to the genus _\")_. Out of the 1,000 or more known species of ribbon worms, only a handful possess a branching proboscis like this one.\nThe fleshy tube is an infolding of the body wall that can evert like the  – and if you watch the footage closely, you'll notice that the worm actually discards it.\n\"The reason for the expelling of the proboscis is that the worm thinks that it is attacked,\" said Kvist. \"It's trying to leave the proboscis behind for the predator so that it can escape – it's trying everything to stay alive.\"\nKvist adds that while some nemerteans can regenerate lost body parts like earthworms, no records of that remarkable ability exist for this species. So even if the ribbon worm somehow stayed alive long enough to be returned to the sea, it would no longer have been able to hunt.\nIt seems very unlikely that the unfortunate creature ended up on a dry rock by natural means. Most ribbon worms live on the sea floor, and many hide out beneath shells and amongst mussel beds. This choice of habitat leaves the animals particularly vulnerable to accidental catch.\nShould you be lucky enough to spot one of these rarely seen worms in the wild, resist the urge to handle it. And if you happen to find one lurking in your shellfish catch, always release it as soon as possible.\n]\n\\_\\_\nTop header image: \n]\nEarth Touch News\n#### Sarah Keartes\nSarah Keartes is a science and wildlife journalist based in the Pacific Northwest....[Content truncated]",

(Photo Credits: Instagram)\nThe footage shows a slimy ribbon worm crawling across a man’s hand and extending a tree-like structure known as a proboscis.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*   Follow us:\nThe world is full of fascinating creatures, each boasting unique biological traits. One such video capturing a remarkable creature, the ribbon worm, has recently gone viral. The undated footage shows a slimy ribbon worm crawling across a man’s hand and extending a tree-like structure known as a proboscis. This proboscis is used by the ribbon worm to ensnare its prey, which it then pulls towards its mouth and consumes whole. Remarkably, ribbon worms can capture and eat prey up to three times their own size.\nA popular X account shared the video of the ribbon worm shooting its proboscis. So far, this clip has over three lakh views.\n> Probably one of the most 'alien-like' species, the ribbon worm spits a living, tree-like proboscis to hunt it prey— Massimo (@Rainmaker1973) \nIn the comments, many people expressed awe as well the feelings of fear and disgust towards the strange-looking worm.

In fact, they typically survive for only about ten minutes in the open air.\nWhen a similar clip , nemertean specialist Dr Sebastian Kvist, who is also an associate curator of invertebrates at Royal Ontario Museum, noted that the animals sometimes fall apart if handled. When this happens, the severed pieces can continue wriggling around like animated copies of a parent worm.\nWe checked in with Kvist about this more recent encounter, and he confirmed that the ribbon worm in the video was in very bad shape. \"My best guess is that the worm is dying and that's why it's breaking apart,\" he explained.\nThere isn't much information about where the sighting was filmed, but we suspect that the worm belongs to the genus _\")_. Out of the 1,000 or more known species of ribbon worms, only a handful possess a branching proboscis like this one.\nThe fleshy tube is an infolding of the body wall that can evert like the  – and if you watch the footage closely, you'll notice that the worm actually discards it.\n\"The reason for the expelling of the proboscis is that the worm thinks that it is attacked,\" said Kvist. \"It's trying to leave the proboscis behind for the predator so that it can escape – it's trying everything to stay alive.\"\nKvist adds that while some nemerteans can regenerate lost body parts like earthworms, no records of that remarkable ability exist for this species. So even if the ribbon worm somehow stayed alive long enough to be returned to the sea, it would no longer have been able to hunt.\nIt seems very unlikely that the unfortunate creature ended up on a dry rock by natural means. Most ribbon worms live on the sea floor, and many hide out beneath shells and amongst mussel beds. This choice of habitat leaves the animals particularly vulnerable to accidental catch.\nShould you be lucky enough to spot one of these rarely seen worms in the wild, resist the urge to handle it. And if you happen to find one lurking in your shellfish catch, always release it as soon as possible.\n]\n\\_\\_\nTop header image: \n]\nEarth Touch News\n#### Sarah Keartes\nSarah Keartes is a science and wildlife journalist based in the Pacific Northwest....[Content truncated]"

    "QA": {
        "Question": "Does the video actually show a ribbon worm spitting a living, tree-like proboscis?",
        "Answer": "Yes, the video does indeed show a ribbon worm spitting a living, tree-like proboscis. The evidence indicates that ribbon worms, which belong to the phylum Nemertea, have the ability to extend a structure known as a proboscis, which they use to ensnare prey. According to a report discussing the video, the ribbon worm was observed crawling and extending a tree-like proboscis, which it then uses to capture prey. This behavior is characteristic of certain species of ribbon worms, which can utilize their proboscis to capture and pull prey towards their mouth to consume it. Additionally, it's noted that the reaction of the worm spitting out or extending the proboscis can be a response to perceived threats, indicating a level of stress that can occur in these delicate creatures when handled outside their natural aquatic environments. As described, this action serves as a means for the worm to escape predators while still trying to capture prey. Overall, the descriptions provided in the referenced articles affirm that the video in question accurately depicts a ribbon worm displaying its typical hunting behavior by extending a proboscis that resembles a tree-like structure.",
