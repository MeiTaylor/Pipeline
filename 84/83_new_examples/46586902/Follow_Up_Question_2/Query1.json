The majority of the approximately 900 known nemertean species are found in marine habitats. Some, however, live in freshwater or on land. The name proboscis worm derives from the muscular eversible proboscis, which is housed in a fluid-filled chamber above the gut. This tube-shaped organ, which in many aquatic forms has a needlelike stylet, is typically used to trap prey. The stylet may also be used for burrowing; in land-dwelling species it may be used for rapid movement.\nThe ribbon worms are the simplest animals to possess a circulatory system and a gut with a separate mouth and anus. The body is usually long and slender and is often extended greatly during movement. Most species are less than 20 cm (8 inches) long, but the giant species Lineus longissimus may reach a length of 30 m (100 feet). Some forms that swim in deep water are flat and broad, with finlike appendages. Often uniformly coloured, various species of ribbon worms are vividly patterned with stripes, bands, speckles, or geometric shapes.\nMale and female ribbon worms occur in most species, with annual reproduction typical...[Content truncated]",

All six specimens are identified as genus Prostoma. Species identification is not concluded and also no conclusion is made whether any of the specimens are of a new or undescribed species. Some specimen photographs are provided and a discussion is given on specimen characteristics and their possible identification. Ribbon worms are not previously reported in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\nJournal InformationThe Journal of the North Carolina Academy of Science (formerly the Journal of the Elisha Mitchell Scientific Society, Vol. 1-118) is the oldest continuously published state science academy journal in the United States, first published in 1884.

Although many different kinds of animals are commonly lumped together as âworms,â there are several distinct phyla that fit the category. Worms are typically long, thin creatures that get around efficiently without legs. The different phyla of worms display a great range in size, complexity, and body structure. Flatworms (phylum Platyhelminthes) are simple animals that are slightly more complex than a cnidarian. Roundworms (phylum Nematoda) have a slightly more complex body plan. Segmented worms (phylum Annelida) are the most complex animals with worm-like body plans. A study of worms can illuminate a possible history of how some organ systems and body features evolved.\n**Fig. 3.35.** (**A**) A whale shark (_Rhincodon typus_; a vertebrate animal)\nImage courtesy of Tanaka Juuyoh, \n**Fig. 3.35.**Â (**B**) A swimming polychaete worm (_Tomopteris_ sp.; an invertebrate animal in the phylum Annelida)\n* * *\nWorms are invertebrate animals with bilateral symmetry.

Most species of phylumÂ **Nemertea**Â are marine, predominantly benthic or bottom dwellers, with an estimated 900 species known. However, nemertini have been recorded in freshwater and terrestrial habitats as well. Most nemerteans are carnivores, feeding on worms, clams, and crustaceans. Some species are scavengers, and some nemertini species, likeÂ _Malacobdella grossa_, have also evolved commensalistic relationships with some mollusks. Some species have devastated commercial fishing of clams and crabs. Nemerteans have almost no predators and two species are sold as fish bait.\nMorphology\n----------\n!\nFigureÂ 1. The proboscis worm (_Parborlasia corrugatus_) is a scavenger that combs the sea floor for food. The species is a member of the phylum Nemertea. The specimen shown here was photographed in the Ross Sea, Antarctica. (credit: Henry Kaiser, National Science Foundation)\nRibbon worms vary in size from 1 cm to several meters. They show bilateral symmetry and remarkable contractile properties. Because of their contractility, they can change their morph...[Content truncated]",

The macroscopic editor is the final organic editor in the game and possibly where players will be spending most of their time in the creature stages, so we must be very considerate about itâs accessibility and practicality.\nI would like confirmation from our programming team about the feasibility of itâs implementation and the work that might be needed to make this concept a reality when possible, and of course I would like to hear everyoneâs thoughts on the concept and how agreeable it is.  \nShould everyone be in favor of this, we can begin filling in the finer details of the editor, and finally move on to the gameplay side of the macroscopic stage.\nItâs a general comment, but Iâve always wondered: if weâre aiming for an âEarthlikeâ progression of life, wonât most of these buttons not get used for most of the game? The last time tetrapods gained a new limb metaball was before we crawled onto land. Most of the evolution we think of in complex animals is really fine-tuning existing structures, not sticking on new parts.\nNow if this is just a focus on Macroscopic and weâre trying to focus on the Cambrian explosion where everything is kind of the same jelly critter on the outside but with wildly different arrangements of jelly parts, my argument probably holds a lot less merit.\nI think thatâs more a question specifically related to progression more so than the underlying mechanics of the macroscopic editor. After trying to make an editor concept while trying to keep progression (specifically, early eumetazoan evolution) in mind, I can say itâs pretty difficult to create a universally applicable editor by limiting focus to a specific era of evolutionary history while trying to extrapolate these findings to other eras of evolutionary history at the same time. Like Buckly has done, I think itâs better if we create general principles and envision general mechanics first, then think of specific case studies and refine the details as we go along, which is something Iâll be focusing on.\nAlso something of interest: Willistonâs Law. A user on the community forums in this thread () put it this way:\n> _âmost organisms have ended up with their characteristic arrangement of parts by first evolving many similar parts and then specializing or losing those parts over time.â_\nHence, for example, many types of bony fish having more fins than tetrapods have limbs, or the ancestor of arthropods tending to have many more limbs than current arthropods such as was seen in trilobites. Note that Willistonâs Law isnât necessarily canon - currently scientists prefer explanations of variances in...[Content truncated]",

Beardworms live near seafloor vents.\n\n\nAdult animals that have soft, elongated, often tubelike bodies and that lack backbones are commonly called worms. Worms are so different from one another that zoologists do not classify them together in a single group; they place them in about a dozen different and often unrelated taxonomic groups called phyla. In everyday language the name worm may be loosely applied to other animals as wellâto the larvae, or immature forms, of some insects, for example, or even to some vertebrates, such as the blindworm, a limbless, snakelike lizard. However, the name is properly applied only to certain adult invertebrates.\nWorms play a major role in virtually all ecosystems. Some terrestrial worms condition the soil. Many worms are parasites of plants and animals, including humans. Many free-living, or nonparasitic, worms form an important link in food chains.\nAll worms are bilaterally symmetrical, meaning that the two sides of their bodies are identical. They lack scales and true limbs, though they may have appendages such as fins and bristles. Many worms have sense organs to detect chemical changes in their environments, and some have light-sensing organs.\nDifferent groups of worms may have significantly different internal characteristics. Flatworms, for example, lack a coelomâa cavity in the body between the internal organs and the body wall. They may also lack a digestive tract, or the digestive tract may be greatly simplified. Proboscis worms also lack a coelom, but they are more advanced than flatworms, in terms of evolution, because they have a complete gut with a separate mouth and anus and a true circulatory system. Roundworms have a complete digestive system and a pseudocoel, or false coelom. Segmented worms are the most advanced because they have a true coelom and well-developed digestive, respiratory, circulatory, and nervous systems.\nSome worms are extremely mobile; they may burrow, crawl, or swim. Other worms are sedentary and live in burrows or tubes that they have built for themselves. Some worms are scavengers, others are carnivorous predators, and still others are totally parasitic.\nSome worms reproduce sexually.

The foregut, stomach and intestine run a little below the midline of the body, the  is at the tip of the tail, and the mouth is under the front. A little above the gut is the rhynchocoel, a cavity which mostly runs above the midline and ends a little short of the rear of the body. All species have a  which lies in the rhynchocoel when inactive but  to emerge just above the mouth to capture the animal's prey with venom.
