The morphology of the proboscis is used to distinguish two classes of nemertean worms: Anopla and Enopla (Gibson, 1970). These two classes both have unique adaptations to the proboscis which set them apart. The first major difference between the two classes is if the proboscis contains a stylet at the anterior end. Enoplan worms contain a stylet apparatus which they use to stab their prey and inject them with toxins and other digestive juices. Anoplan worms on the other hand do not have a stylet so their proboscis has a sticky coating that is covered in toxins that are used to immobilize their prey. The toxins of most nemerteans are produced and secreted by the posterior proboscis epithelium (Gibson, 1970). Anoplan nemertean worms have a separate mouth and gut opening from the aperture that their proboscis is everted from whereas the nemertean worms in the class Enopla have their gut and proboscis using a common orifice of the rhynchocoel (Gibson, 1970).\nWhen Enoplan worms locate their prey, the proboscis is everted with such a substantial force that the tip strikes the prey on the ventral side which is more vulnerable to the stylet (McDermott & Roe, 1985). The stylet of the proboscis pierces the prey and injects a toxin which immobilizes the nemertean’s prey and can even kill it. Multiple punctures of the target organism with the stylet may be required before the toxins reach an effective concentration to restrain the prey. This allows for the nemertean worm to use its head to feed on the now powerless organism. Nemertean worms also have two to eight accessory stylets which form in stylet pouches that are replacements for the main stylet if damaged or removed (Gibson, 1970). Anopla worms coil their proboscis around their prey and hold onto it until it cannot move anymore or dies from the toxins. Chemoreceptors are believed to be used to locate the nemerteans prey however this is not always the case for all nemertean worms.\nUnderstanding how the nemertean worms feed and what they prey on is...[Content truncated]",

Dis­tinc­tions be­tween the classes and or­ders lie in the pres­ence of body ar­mor­ing ( has no armor and  is typ­i­cally armed with stylets), pro­boscis con­struc­tion, mouth po­si­tion rel­a­tive to the cere­bral gan­glion, and body mor­phol­ogy ( is mor­pho­log­i­cally spe­cial­ized into three re­gions (with the ex­cep­tion of Bdel­lone­merta), while  is not), as well as gut shape, body wall mus­cle lay­er­ing, and po­si­tion­ing of lon­gi­tu­di­nal nerve cords.

        "Question": "What specific features or behaviors in the video confirm it depicts a ribbon worm rather than another species?",
        "Answer": "The video depicts a ribbon worm rather than another species due to several specific features and behaviors observed in it. The proboscis structure and function are characteristic of ribbon worms, specifically the muscular, eversible proboscis adapted for hunting and capturing prey, as demonstrated when the worm spat out a tree-like formation. The dynamic movements and reactions to perceived threats, coupled with the extensions of the proboscis for hunting, further confirm its identity as a ribbon worm. Additionally, the long, slender body morphology observed aligns with typical characteristics of ribbon worms in the phylum Nemertea.",
