Its length: up to 55 meters.\n!An entangled bootlace worm. Photo by Bruno C. Vellutini.\\*\nThe bootlace worm is a member of the phylum Nemertea, commonly known as ribbon worms, and is found along the shores of the Atlantic Ocean in Europe. Most of the time, the worm is contracted, forming what looks like a heap of entagled wool threads that has no more than 30 cm from side to side. Although there are reports of specimens measuring more than 50 m, most of them are much shorter, with 30 m being already a very large size. Its width is of about 0.5 cm, so it is almost literally a long brown thread.\n!_Lineus longissimus_ photographed in Norway. Photo by Guido Schmitz.\\*\\*\nAs all nemerteans, the bootlace worm is a predator and hunts its prey between the rocks on sandy shores, stunning them with its long poisonous proboscis and then swallowing them whole. Soft and fragile, the bootlace worm has no way to protect itself from predators using any physical defense, but it is known to have a series of different toxins on its epidermis, including some similar to the deadly pufferfish poison tetrodotoxin (TTX) that is produced by bacteria living in the mucus that surrounds the body of the worm.\nAdvertisement\nNow, before leaving, take a look at this video of a bootlace worm swallowing a polychaete:\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nReferences:\nCantell, C.-E.

In the present report, we provide additional results of a detailed and comprehensive analysis of TTXs distribution in the nemertean\u2019s proboscis, buccal cavity, and cephalic gland using an integrated approach including high-performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC\u2013MS/MS), confocal laser scanning microscopy with anti-TTX antibodies, light and electron microscopies, and observations of feeding behavior. For the proboscis, we have found a TTXs profile different from that characteristic of other organs and tissues. We have also shown for the first time that the major amount of TTXs is localized in the anterior part of the proboscis that is mainly involved in hunting. TTX-containing glandular cells, which can be involved in the prey immobilization, have been found in the buccal cavities of the nemerteans. A significant contribution of the cephalic gland to the toxicity of this animal has been shown for the first time, and the role of the gland is hypothesized to be involved not only in protection against potential enemies but also in immobilizing prey. The data obtained have made it possible to extend the understanding of the role and features of the use of TTXs in the organs of the anterior part of nemertean\u2019s body.\n**Keywords:** tetrodotoxin, tetrodotoxin analogues, TTX, HPLC\u2013MS/MS, nemertea, buccal cavity, cephalic gland, proboscis\n1\\.

A team of Japanese researchers led by Noguchi \\\\] obtained the first data on the toxicity of this nemertean species. In their analysis of approximately 200 specimens of _C. simula_ (in the cited study referred to as _C. linearis_ \\\\]), all of the specimens had strong paralytic toxicity. After it was proven in 2000 and 2003 that TTXs explain the major part of paralytic toxicity in representatives of _C. simula_, researchers in different fields showed increasing interest in this species \\,\\]. In the subsequent years, studies were carried out not only on the taxonomy, geographical distribution, and general biology but also on various aspects of its toxicity.

The morphology of the proboscis is used to distinguish two classes of nemertean worms: Anopla and Enopla (Gibson, 1970). These two classes both have unique adaptations to the proboscis which set them apart. The first major difference between the two classes is if the proboscis contains a stylet at the anterior end. Enoplan worms contain a stylet apparatus which they use to stab their prey and inject them with toxins and other digestive juices. Anoplan worms on the other hand do not have a stylet so their proboscis has a sticky coating that is covered in toxins that are used to immobilize their prey. The toxins of most nemerteans are produced and secreted by the posterior proboscis epithelium (Gibson, 1970). Anoplan nemertean worms have a separate mouth and gut opening from the aperture that their proboscis is everted from whereas the nemertean worms in the class Enopla have their gut and proboscis using a common orifice of the rhynchocoel (Gibson, 1970).\nWhen Enoplan worms locate their prey, the proboscis is everted with such a substantial force that the tip strikes the prey on the ventral side which is more vulnerable to the stylet (McDermott & Roe, 1985). The stylet of the proboscis pierces the prey and injects a toxin which immobilizes the nemertean\u2019s prey and can even kill it. Multiple punctures of the target organism with the stylet may be required before the toxins reach an effective concentration to restrain the prey. This allows for the nemertean worm to use its head to feed on the now powerless organism. Nemertean worms also have two to eight accessory stylets which form in stylet pouches that are replacements for the main stylet if damaged or removed (Gibson, 1970). Anopla worms coil their proboscis around their prey and hold onto it until it cannot move anymore or dies from the toxins. Chemoreceptors are believed to be used to locate the nemerteans prey however this is not always the case for all nemertean worms.\nUnderstanding how the nemertean worms feed and what they prey on is...[Content truncated]",
