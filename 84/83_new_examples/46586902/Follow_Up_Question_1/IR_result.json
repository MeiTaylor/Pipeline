Introduction\n----------------\nNemerteans are mostly marine, soft-bodied, vermiform invertebrates distributed worldwide, often inhabiting under rocks, among sessile organisms or within various sediments along coastal areas \\\\]. With approximately 1200 known species \\\\], they comprise the phylum Nemertea, which is classified into three subgroups, Palaeonemertea, Pilidiophora (=Heteronemertea + _Hubrechtella_ and related forms) and Hoplonemertea \\,,\\]. They are generally carnivorous, with no morphological or behavioral means of protection against potential predators. Their food items so far studied include, among others, annelids, crustaceans and mollusks \\,,,,,\\]. They rely on various toxic or noxious chemicals for their defense and predation \\,\\]. The earliest report that nemerteans possessed toxins was by Bacq \\,\\], who discovered two neurotoxins, each from (1) _Amphiporus lactifloreus_ and _Drepanophorus crassus_ and (2) _Lineus longissimus_ and “_Lineus lacteus_” (=_Ramphogordius lacteus_). He suggested that these substances, which he called “amphiporine” and “némertine”, respectively, served in a defensive role, rather than being offensive venoms, such as those frequently associated with the prey captured by a characteristic eversible organ, the proboscis. This suggestion was supported by Kem \\,,\\] who reported that 70% of the total anabaseine present in the hoplonemertean, _Paranemertes peregrina_, was located in its integument. Species of _Amphiporus_, _Cerebratulus_, _Lineus_ and _Tetrastemma_ have also been found to contain other toxins, including neurotoxic polypeptides and pyridyl alkaloids \\,\\]. Nemerteans are unique among metazoans in possessing an eversible proboscis, housed in a coelom-homologous \\,\\], fluid-filled body cavity, the rhynchocoel.

    "QA": {
        "Question": "What specific characteristics of the proboscis in the video support the claim of it being tree-like?",
        "Answer": "The claim that the proboscis displayed by the ribbon worm in the video is tree-like is supported by several specific characteristics observed in the evidence. 1. **Branching Structure**: The tree-like appearance of the proboscis likely refers to its branching characteristics, which may resemble the limbs of a tree. This is suggested by the description of the worm being able to spit out a \"tree-like structure,\" which indicates that the proboscis can extend and possibly form branches or extensions that mimic a tree's silhouette [Query 1_evidence 2]. 2. **Eversion Mechanism**: The proboscis of ribbon worms is eversible, meaning it can be turned inside out and extended quickly to capture prey. This action may create a temporary structure that, when fully extended, could visually resemble the rough outline of a tree. According to biological studies, an eversible proboscis enables these worms to capture prey with explosive force, allowing for swift movements that could amplify its tree-like appearance during display or hunting [Query 1_evidence 1]. 3. **Dynamic Movement**: The highly developed muscles of ribbon worms enable them to contract and manipulate their bodies, which may affect how the proboscis is displayed. In the video, the worm attempts to avoid being touched before it extends its proboscis. This dynamic reaction could also contribute to the perception of the proboscis as tree-like as it sways or moves in response to stimuli, much like branches reacting to the wind [Query 1_evidence 2]. Overall, these characteristics of the proboscis — its ability to branch out, the mechanics of eversion, and dynamic muscular control — collectively support the claim of it resembling a tree-like structure.",
