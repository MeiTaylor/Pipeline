The foregut, stomach and intestine run a little below the midline of the body, the  is at the tip of the tail, and the mouth is under the front. A little above the gut is the rhynchocoel, a cavity which mostly runs above the midline and ends a little short of the rear of the body. All species have a  which lies in the rhynchocoel when inactive but  to emerge just above the mouth to capture the animal's prey with venom.

While the clip can disgust some users, others found it \"cool and creepy\" at the same time. The species in question is a ribbon worm, very slim and only a few millimetres wide.

Introduction\n----------------\nNemerteans are mostly marine, soft-bodied, vermiform invertebrates distributed worldwide, often inhabiting under rocks, among sessile organisms or within various sediments along coastal areas \\\\]. With approximately 1200 known species \\\\], they comprise the phylum Nemertea, which is classified into three subgroups, Palaeonemertea, Pilidiophora (=Heteronemertea + _Hubrechtella_ and related forms) and Hoplonemertea \\,,\\]. They are generally carnivorous, with no morphological or behavioral means of protection against potential predators. Their food items so far studied include, among others, annelids, crustaceans and mollusks \\,,,,,\\]. They rely on various toxic or noxious chemicals for their defense and predation \\,\\]. The earliest report that nemerteans possessed toxins was by Bacq \\,\\], who discovered two neurotoxins, each from (1) _Amphiporus lactifloreus_ and _Drepanophorus crassus_ and (2) _Lineus longissimus_ and “_Lineus lacteus_” (=_Ramphogordius lacteus_). He suggested that these substances, which he called “amphiporine” and “némertine”, respectively, served in a defensive role, rather than being offensive venoms, such as those frequently associated with the prey captured by a characteristic eversible organ, the proboscis. This suggestion was supported by Kem \\,,\\] who reported that 70% of the total anabaseine present in the hoplonemertean, _Paranemertes peregrina_, was located in its integument. Species of _Amphiporus_, _Cerebratulus_, _Lineus_ and _Tetrastemma_ have also been found to contain other toxins, including neurotoxic polypeptides and pyridyl alkaloids \\,\\]. Nemerteans are unique among metazoans in possessing an eversible proboscis, housed in a coelom-homologous \\,\\], fluid-filled body cavity, the rhynchocoel. In marine, free-living nemerteans, the proboscis is used in prey capture...[Content truncated]",

The last time tetrapods gained a new limb metaball was before we crawled onto land. Most of the evolution we think of in complex animals is really fine-tuning existing structures, not sticking on new parts.\nNow if this is just a focus on Macroscopic and we’re trying to focus on the Cambrian explosion where everything is kind of the same jelly critter on the outside but with wildly different arrangements of jelly parts, my argument probably holds a lot less merit.\nI think that’s more a question specifically related to progression more so than the underlying mechanics of the macroscopic editor. After trying to make an editor concept while trying to keep progression (specifically, early eumetazoan evolution) in mind, I can say it’s pretty difficult to create a universally applicable editor by limiting focus to a specific era of evolutionary history while trying to extrapolate these findings to other eras of evolutionary history at the same time. Like Buckly has done, I think it’s better if we create general principles and envision general mechanics first, then think of specific case studies and refine the details as we go along, which is something I’ll be focusing on.\nAlso something of interest: Williston’s Law. A user on the community forums in this thread () put it this way:\n> _“most organisms have ended up with their characteristic arrangement of parts by first evolving many similar parts and then specializing or losing those parts over time.”_\nHence, for example, many types of bony fish having more fins than tetrapods have limbs, or the ancestor of arthropods tending to have many more limbs than current arthropods such as was seen in trilobites. Note that Williston’s Law isn’t necessarily canon - currently scientists prefer explanations of variances in evolutionary rates more than general principles of morphological complexity - but it could be a line of thinking which is implemented well in Thrive given the more artificial nature of our evolution. It also reveals that early on in metazoan evolution, experimentation with...[Content truncated]",

Although many different kinds of animals are commonly lumped together as “worms,” there are several distinct phyla that fit the category. Worms are typically long, thin creatures that get around efficiently without legs. The different phyla of worms display a great range in size, complexity, and body structure. Flatworms (phylum Platyhelminthes) are simple animals that are slightly more complex than a cnidarian. Roundworms (phylum Nematoda) have a slightly more complex body plan. Segmented worms (phylum Annelida) are the most complex animals with worm-like body plans. A study of worms can illuminate a possible history of how some organ systems and body features evolved.\n**Fig. 3.35.** (**A**) A whale shark (_Rhincodon typus_; a vertebrate animal)\nImage courtesy of Tanaka Juuyoh, \n**Fig. 3.35.** (**B**) A swimming polychaete worm (_Tomopteris_ sp.; an invertebrate animal in the phylum Annelida)\n* * *\nWorms are invertebrate animals with bilateral symmetry. Worms have a definite anterior (head) end and a posterior (tail) end. The **ventral** surface of worms and other organisms is the bottom side of the body, often closest to the ground. The **dorsal** surface is located on the upper part of the body facing the sky. The **lateral** surfaces are found on the left and right sides of the body.

(I cannot decide whether I find them fascinating or gross…maybe they can be both)\nWell, this phylum of organisms used to be thought to be directly related to the  we covered previously, but now they are thought to have arisen separately, whereas flatworms and Cnidaria are thought to have evolved from one ancestral species, with one line of descendants becoming the radial corals and jellyfish, and another heading off to become the flatworms, with the bilateral symmetry.\nThe latest research, looking at both genetics, and how cells develop within an organism (cell lineage) appears to show that they are not related to flatworms, but nevertheless, they have some similar features, as well as some which are more evolved, and one very unique feature.\nLets start with what they have in common, and work out from there.\nThey have bilateral symmetry, and a triploblast body (the three levels of cell within the body) both of which we first saw in the flatworms. ( for the diagrams from that post)\nThey do not have a body cavity as such, so they are usually classified as acoelomate, but they have a special structure, which we will get to shortly, and so there is discussion about whether this is a body cavity or not.\nThe image below is a diagram of a Nemertea, and hopefully you can see the similarities to the cross section of the flatworms \nHere is a cross-section of a flatworm for easier comparison:\nNemertea also have the protonephridia that flatworm have (the flame cells which act as a simple excretory system), and they are able to reproduce both asexually, and sexually, also like the flatworms.\nSo, they have a few features in common, what do they have different?\nFirstly, they have an exit to their digestive system (you can see this at the bottom of the picture above).  This means that solid waste does not exit through the same orifice as food goes in by.  They therefore have a complete digestive system, although still a very simple digestive system, without the liver, kidneys and other organs which we have.  Apart from the obvious yuk factor to only having one way in and out for food and waste, what is the advantage of having two ends to your digestive system?\nWell, firstly, I do not think animals are bothered by the yuk factor in the way we are, but there is a very clear advantage to having both a mouth, and an anus.  The advantage is, simply, that you can eat and excrete simultaneously, which means having a complete digestive system is more efficient.\nAnother important development is that Nemerteans have what is known as a closed loop blood-vascular system.  ...[Content truncated]",

Some worms stick feathery external gills up into the water where there is more oxygen, and others pump water into their burrows to bring oxygen down to them  Some worms have blood just like ours that can store oxygen, which gives them their red color.\n  fireworm  According to Frontiers: Just like the earthworms in a garden that eat dirt, many worms on the ocean floor eat sediment. Some of the best worm food on the ocean floor comes from dead plankton, fish poop, and other goo produced by organisms in the water that sinks to the sediment surface creating detritus. Worms have special guts with a kind of soap that helps them digest the detritus that coats the sand grains. However, marine worms do not eat just detritus—some of them are carnivores or scavengers, some are herbivores, and some are parasites. Some worms have teeth, jaws, or even venomous fangs for capturing prey or grazing on plants. Some vegetarian worms scrape algae from rocks with special teeth. Compared to the earthworms in a garden, worms in the ocean have evolved a spectacular variety of body parts used to find, grab, and hold onto food.  [Source:  Kara J. Gadeken, Erin Kiskaddon, Jenna M. Moore, Kelly M. Dorgan Frontiers, November 14, 2022]\nMany animals like to eat worms, so worms have evolved numerous ways to avoid predators. Worms that swim in the water or crawl around on the seafloor surface are more exposed, so they often have venomous or irritating spines or use stinky or poisonous chemicals to be less tasty. Some worms hide from predators by building burrows or tubes in sediment. To resist getting pulled or sucked out of their homes, worms use stiff hairs on their bodies to hold onto their tubes or burrows. It is common to find worms that are growing back their tails or even their heads after having those parts bitten off by a passing fish!\nIn terms of reproduction, Some worms just throw their eggs and sperm into the water, but others turn their tails into a zombie mini-worm that carries eggs or sperm, complete with a new head and eyes. Sometimes worms keep their babies inside or on their bodies or inside their burrows until they are almost grown up. Sometimes worms can clone themselves by splitting in half and regrowing a new head and tail.\nMost marine worms — and most worms period — as we said before belong...[Content truncated]",
