        "Question": "Was there any official statement or reliable news source confirming the authenticity of the TikTok video featuring Anne Hathaway?",
        "Answer": "There has been no official statement or reliable news source confirming the authenticity of the TikTok video featuring Anne Hathaway sharing the joke \"What is 6.9? A good thing ruined by a period.\" In fact, multiple reputable sources indicate that the video is fake and generated using artificial intelligence. Specifically, an article from Indy100 clearly states that the viral TikTok clip claiming to show Hathaway making the joke is artificial and does not represent a real interaction on \"The Daily Show\" with Jon Stewart. This assertion is further supported by user comments pointing out the video's artificial nature, acknowledging that it was created using AI technology, which adds to the reasons to doubt its authenticity.",
