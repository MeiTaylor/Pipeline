The incident involved a daring slide ride in a New York City park when her 12-month-old son was on her lap.\n_The Intern_ performer playfully recounted how they unexpectedly picked up speed, pulled by gravity, and caused a moment of panic. Her vivid retelling evoked laughter from both the audience and interviewer, showcasing her signature charm and wit.\nOn _The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon,_ Hathaway recreated the near-miss, humorously describing her thoughts in that thrilling-fueled moment.\nDespite the near-accident, she lightheartedly admitted that they stuck the landing with style. She explained,\n> _“I shoot off the slide with Johnny and I stuck that landing. You know when you almost killed your child, but you didn’t. In the inside you’re like, Everything’s OK. Walk it off, walk it off.”_\nHowever, As a loving mother, Hathaway embraces her role with fierce anticipation and joy.\nSource: \n]\nArticles Published: 694\nMuskan Chaudhary, Junior Content Writer at Fandom wire.

But in her defense, she did describe it in such a way that began with a PhD student and ended with a boy in a coma, and it did sound a _little_ silly. While she definitely didn't mean for it to come out that way, both of them couldn't control themselves.\nComedy Central\n\"Your brother's in a coma, that is true,\" Stewart said while tearing up from laughing so hard. \"I've seen it and that was still a bit of a spoiler alert. I'm sorry.\"\nPractically in tears, Hathaway recalled that a journalist told her that while he was watching the coma scene, he fell off his treadmill! Of course, the talk show host couldn't pass up the opportunity to mock himself when she said that.\n\"Here's the only difference between me and that guy,\" he said. \"I don't use the treadmill! I did fall off there, but I do not use it.\"\nThe duo tried to get back to their normal interview conversation, but it never happened. They stuck to their goofy selves and continued to laugh their way through the rest of the interview, even while talking about the \"serious and important in-depth exploration of family dynamics.\"\nHathaway not only stars in but also produces the film.\n**Watch the video above to see Stewart and Hathaway completely lose it!**",
