Or just in movies?\nWhen did Adam Sandler stop being funny?\nRight around the time we started growing up.\nAdam Sandler was never funny. We were just younger, less mature and way less picky. His two biggest hits, Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison were high school favorites amongst my classmates. We all thought those movies were so hilarious, we went around quoting lines from them.\nHad those movies come out today on Netflix, they\u2019d get the same terrible reviews as Sandler\u2019s latest string of flops.\n!\nThe saddest part about growing up is realizing someone or something was never as funny as you remembered- you were just younger then.\nBut it\u2019s hard to hate on a dude that\u2019s super loyal to his group of friends. Thanks to Sandler, many of his less talented homies stay employed year round.\nAre Adam Sandler films just plain stupid?\nBasically, yes.\nAnd those that think some of his earlier work was funnier were just younger when they watched it.\nIn one movie he's an adult that repeats grade school in order to inherit his father\u2019s money.\nIn another, he adopts a kid to impress his ex-girlfriend.\nHe played the role of inbred football star.\nHe also played a hockey player turned pro golfer.\nLet's not forget the one where he's an...\nWhat do few people know about actor Adam Sandler's personal life?\nAdam Sandler told in a 2017 interview that his daughters aren't big fans of his movies!\n!\nThe actor explained that they always ask to see a movie of him, but give up on watching halfway through.\n\"I do. Because they beg to see \\ So I show them \\ and they see it every time, about 20 minutes, and then I see them dispersing, and I hear them. They get nervous to say, but they ask 'Can we see something else?'\"\nThe girls were still young when the interview took place, they were 7 and 11 years old. Therefore, the actor believes that it was a matter of time before his offspring came to love his comedies.\nBut what about you, do you like the Adam Sandler movies or not?",

Since New York's voice in culture is very loud, that's what you hear about.\nI have driven across the country 5 times, been to more than 40 states, lived in 5 of them and I can tell you that on the level of beauty, New Jersey is simply average.\n!\nA lot of New Jersey is basic suburbia. It suffers from the same issues that northern suburbs do. Cold winters will crack up the roads and fill them with salt stain. Late winter in Jersey feels really dingy. But spring looks beautiful. Unlike Southwestern suburbs, we have huge lush trees to line our streets.\n!\nNew Jersey beaches are gorgeous. I have been to many of the best beaches in the country and New Jersey ranks in the top 4 or 5 states for beaches. As others mentioned, the Shore is much more than Seaside Heights. It's 217 miles long and has fancy dancy Victorian wannabes like Cape May, slightly trashy but fun places like Point Pleasant, and beaches where you only meet residents like Mantoloking. There are wildlife preserves, boaters enclaves, and towns full of nice, working class families.\n!\nThe Appalachian Trail runs through New Jersey. We have lovely parks and mountains to hike through. You will find more challenging trails in some other states, but Jersey is well-suited to the casual hiker.\n!\nDid you know New Jersey has lots of farms? We're particularly well known for our tomatoes and eggplants, but we also produce excellent corn and other products. Sections of Jersey, especially in the West, are known as farm country. I won't claim that we have the best or prettiest farms, but they're certainly pretty enough not to be the armpit.\nStates like Maine and Michigan have lush deep forests that are beautiful. New Mexico and Wyoming have interesting, exotic landscapes. Hawaii and California are beautiful, sunny places. New Jersey is not amazing, but it is simply not the Armpit of America. It has some beauty, some eyesores, and mostly just okay. It is an average state.\nAnd don't go insulting us culturally or I will sic on you Frank Sinatra, Jack Nicholson, Queen Latifah, Kevin Spacey, Buzz Aldrin, Dorothy Parker, Meryl Streep, Norman Mailer, Ice-T, Stephen Crane, and Count Basie.",
