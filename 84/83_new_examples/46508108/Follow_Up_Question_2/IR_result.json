        "Question": "What sources corroborate the claim about Anne Hathaway's appearance in this TikTok video?",
        "Answer": "The claim about Anne Hathaway's appearance in the TikTok video sharing the joke \"What is 6.9? A good thing ruined by a period\" is corroborated by various sources that indicate the video is not genuine.\n\n1. An article from Indy100 clearly states that the viral TikTok clip is fake and created using artificial intelligence. This assertion is grounded in the observation that the video purports to show Hathaway making the joke during an appearance on \"The Daily Show\" with Jon Stewart, which did not actually occur. The piece actively debunks the clip, noting it uses AI technology to convincingly portray an interaction that never took place [Query1_evidence_1].\n\n2. The same Indy100 article highlights user reactions to the video, with many commenting that the interaction is not real and is indeed AI-generated. This collective skepticism from viewers further undermines any claims of authenticity regarding Hathaway’s alleged joke delivery [Query2_evidence_1].\n\nGiven the clarity and consistency of the information across reliable sources and the corroborative viewer feedback, I am confident in saying that the evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the video is not an authentic representation of Anne Hathaway.",
