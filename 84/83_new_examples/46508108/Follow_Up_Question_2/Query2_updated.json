Hathaway gently mocked her own singing in her latest film, . But then the evening took a sharp turn. When Hathaway finished describing the plot of her latest film, she and Stewart both dissolved into uncontrollable laughter. In their defense, the plot description starts with a Ph.D. student in Morocco and ends with a teenager in a coma. Sometimes all you can do is laugh.\nWatching it again, it looks like there _might_ be an edit between the end of Hathaway\u2019s description and when Stewart loses it. (There\u2019s a more obvious edit later in the segment.) But not knowing whether we\u2019re in on the whole joke doesn\u2019t make the derailing of this interview (the giggles continue throughout) any less enjoyable.\n### Hollywood Daily\nFilm, TV, and entertainment industry news. Plus, every Friday, a special Awards Insider edition.\nRead More\nFor the first _Daily Show_ episode since the attempt on Trump\u2019s life, Stewart invited an old sparring partner back into the ring to discuss this \u201cterrible fucking week.\u201d\nIn an excerpt from his new memoir, the director of _Crazy Rich Asians_ and _Wicked_ remembers the shock and awe.\nBy Jon M.

But in her defense, she did describe it in such a way that began with a PhD student and ended with a boy in a coma, and it did sound a _little_ silly. While she definitely didn't mean for it to come out that way, both of them couldn't control themselves.\n!Comedy Central\n\"Your brother's in a coma, that is true,\" Stewart said while tearing up from laughing so hard. \"I've seen it and that was still a bit of a spoiler alert. I'm sorry.\"\nPractically in tears, Hathaway recalled that a journalist told her that while he was watching the coma scene, he fell off his treadmill! Of course, the talk show host couldn't pass up the opportunity to mock himself when she said that.\n\"Here's the only difference between me and that guy,\" he said. \"I don't use the treadmill! I did fall off there, but I do not use it.\"\nTRENDING STORIES\nUndo\nUndo\nUndo\nUndo\nUndo\nThe duo tried to get back to their normal interview conversation, but it never happened. They stuck to their goofy selves and continued to laugh their way through the rest of the interview, even while talking about the \"serious and important in-depth exploration of family dynamics.\"\nHathaway not only stars in but also produces the film.\n**Watch the video above to see Stewart and Hathaway completely lose it!**\nUndo\nUndo\nSkip\nTRENDING STORIES\nUndo\nUndo\nUndo\nUndo\nUndo\nUndo\nUndo\nUndo\nUndo\nYou May Like\nLearn More\nUndo\nLearn More\nUndo\nGet Quote\nUndo\nLearn More\nUndo\nGet Quote\nUndo\nLearn More\nUndo\nSign Up\nUndo\n\")\n\")\nLearn more\nUndo...[Content truncated]",
