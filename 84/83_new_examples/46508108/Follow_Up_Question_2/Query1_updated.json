So I stopped arguing with it.\u201d  \nShe added about how booze used to affect her mood: \u201cMy personal experience with it is that everything is better. For me, it was wallowing fuel. And I don\u2019t like to wallow.  \n\u201cThe thing that I have faith in is that everybody else is going to have one or two drinks, and by the time everybody gets to two drinks, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve had two drinks \u2013 but without the hangover.\u201d  \nAnne\u2019s oldest son Johnathan turned eight on Sunday (24.03.24) and her youngest boy Jack is three.  \nThe actress had both boys with husband Adam Schulman, 42, and also told Variety how she had cut other unhealthy behaviour from her life including scrolling on social media.  \nShe said: \u201cI make a lot of my lifestyle choices in service of supporting mental health.  \n\u201cI stopped participating in things that I know to be draining or can cause spirals. I actually don\u2019t have a relationship with myself online.\u201d  \nTurning to how she had a horrendous panic attack in her 20s, Anne said she has now learned to be kinder to herself especially when she\u2019s stricken with stress.  \nShe added: \u201cI had a horrible anxiety attack and I was by myself and didn\u2019t know what was happening.  \n\u201cI certainly couldn\u2019t tell anybody, and it was compounded by thinking I was keeping set waiting.  \n\u201cNow I feel much safer going to someone in charge, pulling them to the side, and explaining, \u2018I\u2019m going through this right now.\u2019  \n\u201cMost people will sit there with you for the 10 minutes it takes for you to come back down.\u201d\n*   Up next\n*   Up next\n*   Up next\n*...[Content truncated]",
