        "Answer": "Based on the evidence gathered, it appears that Anne Hathaway did not authentically deliver the joke 'What is 6.9? A good thing ruined by a period' in the video. The video circulating on TikTok is reported to be fake and has been created using artificial intelligence technology to simulate her voice and appearance, leading to the authenticity of the interaction being called into question. As mentioned in the source from Indy100, the viral TikTok clip of Anne Hathaway telling the joke is indeed artificial and not a legitimate appearance on 'The Daily Show' with Jon Stewart, as the clip suggests. The article clearly states, 'however, the video is fake' and discusses how AI-generated content can create realistic portrayals of individuals that don’t actually exist. Furthermore, the same evidence highlights that while the clip appears convincing and prompted laughter from those who saw it, this interaction did not occur in reality. Users pointed out that it is fake and generated by AI, confirming doubts about its authenticity.",

        "Answer": "There has been no official statement or reliable news source confirming the authenticity of the TikTok video featuring Anne Hathaway sharing the joke \"What is 6.9? A good thing ruined by a period.\" In fact, multiple reputable sources indicate that the video is fake and generated using artificial intelligence. Specifically, an article from Indy100 clearly states that the viral TikTok clip claiming to show Hathaway making the joke is artificial and does not represent a real interaction on \"The Daily Show\" with Jon Stewart. This assertion is further supported by user comments pointing out the video's artificial nature, acknowledging that it was created using AI technology, which adds to the reasons to doubt its authenticity.",

        "Question": "What sources corroborate the claim about Anne Hathaway's appearance in this TikTok video?",
        "Answer": "The claim about Anne Hathaway's appearance in the TikTok video sharing the joke \"What is 6.9? A good thing ruined by a period\" is corroborated by various sources that indicate the video is not genuine.\n\n1. An article from Indy100 clearly states that the viral TikTok clip is fake and created using artificial intelligence. This assertion is grounded in the observation that the video purports to show Hathaway making the joke during an appearance on \"The Daily Show\" with Jon Stewart, which did not actually occur. The piece actively debunks the clip, noting it uses AI technology to convincingly portray an interaction that never took place [Query1_evidence_1].\n\n2. The same Indy100 article highlights user reactions to the video, with many commenting that the interaction is not real and is indeed AI-generated. This collective skepticism from viewers further undermines any claims of authenticity regarding Hathaway’s alleged joke delivery [Query2_evidence_1].\n\nGiven the clarity and consistency of the information across reliable sources and the corroborative viewer feedback, I am confident in saying that the evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the video is not an authentic representation of Anne Hathaway.",

Therefore, while we can conclude the claim is untrue, a slight uncertainty remains, thus leading to a 90% confidence level."
