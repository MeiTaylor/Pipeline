Pryor, who had been slated to head to Marine Corps boot camp, was notified that he will not be able to join the service because he took part in a racially-charged incident during a rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. (Facebook)\n! \n(Facebook)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 An Indiana recruit has been kicked out of the Marine Corps for taking part in an altercation with a black woman at a Donald Trump rally Tuesday.\nJoseph Pryor of Corydon, Ind., posted a photograph of the incident that shows him appearing to yell at university student Shiya Nwanguma, who was shoved and forcibly removed by Trump supporters in an incident that went viral on the Internet, according to the Marine Corps and Facebook.\nThe Marine Corps Recruiting Station Louisville confirmed to Stars and Stripes on Friday that Pryor was set to ship off for boot camp but was instead discharged for taking part in a racially charged incident.\n\u201cJoseph Pryor demonstrated poor judgment in his use of social media that associates him with a racially charged altercation at a political rally,\u201d according to a statement released by Capt. Oliver David, a spokesman for the recruiting command. \u201cHatred toward any group of individuals is not tolerated in the Marine Corps and he is being discharged from our delayed entry program effective \\.\u201d\nDavid said Pryor had signed up less than a month before the incident and was in the services\u2019 delayed entry program. He had yet to undergo the Marine Corps ethics training.\n\u201cWithout the training, he decided to do something and post it on social media, and because of that we\u2019ve decided to part ways with Mr. Pryor,\u201d David said.\nPryor could not immediately be reached for comment Friday.\nNwanguma said she was pushed, called various expletives \u2013 including the N-word -- and escorted out of the Louisville rally by police. An Hispanic mother and her daughter also reported racist harassment at the event, according to a local television station.\n _Twitter: @_\nstripes Administrator\nstripes Administrator\n### Subscribe to Stars and Stripes\nJust 99c a week! \n* * *\nstars and stripes videos\n------------------------\n* * *\naround the web\n--------------\n* * *\nstripes top news\n----------------\n]\n### \n]\n### \n]\n### \n* * *\nEditors' Picks\n--------------\n*   ]\n    #### \n*   ]\n    #### \n*   ]\n    #### \nVideo Spotlight\n---------------\n**Powered by** \n ]]\nfollow us\n---------\nExplore\n-------\n*    COVID]\n*    Archive photo of the day]\n*    Pacific Storm Tracker]\n*    Opinion]\n*    Today's ePaper]\n*    Contingency Edition]\n*    Weekly Comics...[Content truncated]",

Title VII protects workers from employment discrimination based on their race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, and transgender status),] national origin, or protected activity.\u00a0 Under Title VII, an employer is prohibited from discriminating because of religion in hiring, promotion, discharge, compensation, or other \u201cterms, conditions or privileges\u201d of employment, and also cannot \u201climit, segregate, or classify\u201d applicants or employees based on religion \u201cin any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee.\u201d]\u00a0 The statute defines \u201creligion\u201d as including \u201call aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that \\ is unable to reasonably accommodate .\u00a0.\u00a0. without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer\u2019s business.\u201d]\u00a0 \u201cUndue hardship\u201d under Title VII is not defined in the statute but has been defined by the Supreme Court as \u201cmore than a de minimis cost\u201d] \u2013 a lower standard for employers to satisfy than the \u201cundue hardship\u201d defense under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which is defined by statute as \u201csignificant difficulty or expense.\u201d]\nThese protections apply whether the religious beliefs or practices in question are common \u00a0or non-traditional, and regardless of whether they are recognized by any organized religion.]\u00a0 The test under Title VII\u2019s definition of religion is whether the beliefs are, in the individual\u2019s \u201cown scheme of things, religious.\u201d]\u00a0 Belief in God or gods is not necessary; nontheistic beliefs can also be religious for purposes of the Title VII exemption as long as they \u201c\u2018occupy in the life of that individual \u201ca place parallel to that filled by . . .

The Commission considered evidence from law enforcement and court officials, community leaders and police reform advocates, scholars, legal experts, as well as testimony taken in by the Commission\u2019s State Advisory Committees in Minnesota, New York, Maine, and Delaware. The Commission majority approved key findings including the following: While police officers have the difficult and admirable job of providing crucial services to the communities they protect and serve, their job sometimes puts them in harm\u2019s way and may require the use of force. Accordingly, police officers must operate with the highest standards of professionalism and accountability. Every community resident should be able to live, work, and travel confident in an expectation that interactions with police officers will be fair, consistent with constitutional norms, and guided by public safety free from bias or discrimination. Unfortunately, too many communities are not confident in these expectations, and so these communities have called for reforms to foster better community-police relations and prevent unjustified and excessive police uses of force. Accurate and comprehensive data regarding police uses of force is generally not available to police departments or the American public. No comprehensive national database exists that captures police uses of force. The best available evidence reflects high rates of uses of force nationally, with increased likelihood of police use of force against people of color, people with disabilities, LGBT people, people with mental health concerns, people with low incomes, and those at the intersection of these communities.

Repeated and highly publicized incidents of police use of force against persons of color and people with disabilities, combined with a lack of accurate data, lack of transparency about policies and practices in place governing use of force, and lack of accountability for noncompliance foster a perception that police use of force in communities of color and the disability community is unchecked, unlawful, and unsafe. The Commission majority voted for key recommendations, including that the United States Department of Justice should return to vigorous enforcement of constitutional policing, including under its authority pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14141, and the use of consent decrees where necessary to ensure that constitutional policing standards are upheld. The Department of Justice should robustly support local efforts to develop and institute constitutional policing practices, including through the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) and maintaining the Community Relations Service (CRS) to focus on building community trust and reducing excessive or unauthorized uses of force, in coordination with police departments.
