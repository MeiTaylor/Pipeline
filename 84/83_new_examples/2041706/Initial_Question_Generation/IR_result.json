(Facebook)\n! \n(Facebook)\nWASHINGTON — An Indiana recruit has been kicked out of the Marine Corps for taking part in an altercation with a black woman at a Donald Trump rally Tuesday.\nJoseph Pryor of Corydon, Ind., posted a photograph of the incident that shows him appearing to yell at university student Shiya Nwanguma, who was shoved and forcibly removed by Trump supporters in an incident that went viral on the Internet, according to the Marine Corps and Facebook.\nThe Marine Corps Recruiting Station Louisville confirmed to Stars and Stripes on Friday that Pryor was set to ship off for boot camp but was instead discharged for taking part in a racially charged incident.\n“Joseph Pryor demonstrated poor judgment in his use of social media that associates him with a racially charged altercation at a political rally,” according to a statement released by Capt. Oliver David, a spokesman for the recruiting command. “Hatred toward any group of individuals is not tolerated in the Marine Corps and he is being discharged from our delayed entry program effective \\.”\nDavid said Pryor had signed up less than a month before the incident and was in the services’ delayed entry program. He had yet to undergo the Marine Corps ethics training.\n“Without the training, he decided to do something and post it on social media, and because of that we’ve decided to part ways with Mr. Pryor,” David said.\nPryor could not immediately be reached for comment Friday.\nNwanguma said she was pushed, called various expletives – including the N-word -- and escorted out of the Louisville rally by police. An Hispanic mother and her daughter also reported racist harassment at the event, according to a local television station.\n _Twitter: @_\nstripes Administrator\nstripes Administrator\n### Subscribe to Stars and Stripes\nJust 99c a week! \n* * *\nstars and stripes videos\n------------------------\n* * *\naround the web\n--------------\n* * *\nstripes top news\n----------------\n]\n### \n]\n### \n]\n### \n* * *\nEditors' Picks\n--------------\n*   ]\n    #### \n*   ]\n    #### \n*   ]\n    #### \nVideo Spotlight\n---------------\n**Powered by** \n ]]\nfollow us\n---------\nExplore\n-------\n*    COVID]\n*    Archive photo of the day]\n*    Pacific Storm Tracker]\n*    Opinion]\n*    Today's ePaper]\n*    Contingency Edition]\n*    Weekly Comics...[Content truncated]",

Pryor, who had been slated to head to Marine Corps boot camp, was notified that he will not be able to join the service because he took part in a racially-charged incident during a rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. (Facebook)\n! \n(Facebook)\nWASHINGTON — An Indiana recruit has been kicked out of the Marine Corps for taking part in an altercation with a black woman at a Donald Trump rally Tuesday.\nJoseph Pryor of Corydon, Ind., posted a photograph of the incident that shows him appearing to yell at university student Shiya Nwanguma, who was shoved and forcibly removed by Trump supporters in an incident that went viral on the Internet, according to the Marine Corps and Facebook.\nThe Marine Corps Recruiting Station Louisville confirmed to Stars and Stripes on Friday that Pryor was set to ship off for boot camp but was instead discharged for taking part in a racially charged incident.\n“Joseph Pryor demonstrated poor judgment in his use of social media that associates him with a racially charged altercation at a political rally,” according to a statement released by Capt. Oliver David, a spokesman for the recruiting command. “Hatred toward any group of individuals is not tolerated in the Marine Corps and he is being discharged from our delayed entry program effective \\.”\nDavid said Pryor had signed up less than a month before the incident and was in the services’ delayed entry program. He had yet to undergo the Marine Corps ethics training.\n“Without the training, he decided to do something and post it on social media, and because of that we’ve decided to part ways with Mr. Pryor,” David said.\nPryor could not immediately be reached for comment Friday.\nNwanguma said she was pushed, called various expletives – including the N-word -- and escorted out of the Louisville rally by police. An Hispanic mother and her daughter also reported racist harassment at the event, according to a local television station.\n _Twitter: @_\nstripes Administrator\nstripes Administrator\n### Subscribe to Stars and Stripes\nJust 99c a week! \n* * *\nstars and stripes videos\n------------------------\n* * *\naround the web\n--------------\n* * *\nstripes top news\n----------------\n]\n### \n]\n### \n]\n### \n* * *\nEditors' Picks\n--------------\n*   ]\n    #### \n*   ]\n    #### \n*   ]\n    #### \nVideo Spotlight\n---------------\n**Powered by** \n ]]\nfollow us\n---------\nExplore\n-------\n*    COVID]\n*    Archive photo of the day]\n*    Pacific Storm Tracker]\n*    Opinion]\n*    Today's ePaper]\n*    Contingency Edition]\n*    Weekly Comics...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What specific events in the video confirm the Marine's involvement in a racially charged altercation?",
        "Answer": "The specific events in the video that confirm the Marine's involvement in a racially charged altercation at a Donald Trump rally include the following: 1. **Participation in the Altercation**: Joseph Pryor, the Marine in question, was involved in an altercation with a black woman, Shiya Nwanguma, during the rally. He was seen yelling at her in a photograph he posted on social media, which was shared widely and subsequently led to scrutiny regarding his actions. This aligns with the description of the events as racially charged, as Nwanguma was reportedly pushed and called racial slurs during the incident. The Marine Corps officially stated that his actions demonstrated poor judgment and were against the values of the Marine Corps. 2. **Nature of the Rally Atmosphere**: The reports indicate that the rally atmosphere was charged with racial hostility, noting that Nwanguma was presented with racial slurs and faced physical pushing from Trump supporters. This context establishes the rally as a site of racially charged incidents and the participation of an individual, initially slated to join the Marine Corps, in such activities directly ties him to the altercation. 3. **Official Repercussions**: Following the incident, evidence indicates that Pryor was discharged from the Marine Corps delayed entry program due to his association with this incident. The statement from the Marine Corps emphasized the intolerance of any form of hatred or discrimination, reinforcing that his involvement was taken seriously and deemed unacceptable. In summary, the evidence clearly establishes that Pryor’s involvement in the altercation, the context of racial hostility at the rally, and the immediate consequences of his actions collectively confirm his participation in a racially charged incident at the Trump rally.",
