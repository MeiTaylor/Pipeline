For 17 years, the law prohibited qualified gay, lesbian and bisexual Americans from serving in the armed forces and sent a message that discrimination was acceptable.\nThe Introduction of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d  \n----------------------------------------------\nIn 1994, the U.S. adopted \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d as the official federal policy on military service by lesbian, gay and bisexual individuals. The rule was discrimination in its purest form and prevented service members from being openly queer without threat of being discharged. DADT was based on the false assumption that the presence of LGBTQ+ individuals in any branch of the military would undermine the ability of people to carry out their duties. Over the course of the policy\u2019s life, thousands of brave service members were discharged simply for who they were and whom they loved.\n!(blob:https://www.hrc.org/13eef0f409396896109c31df5bf3235f)\nAMPA Gala\nEnsuring Justice for Service Members Everywhere  \n--------------------------------------------------\nHRC made repealing DADT a top priority \u2014 and public sentiment showed the evolving perceptions of LGBTQ+ people serving openly in the military. By the time President Obama took office, we knew there was a coalition of supporters and elected officials ready to retire this hateful policy once and for all. Our Voices of Honor tour worked with hundreds of LGBTQ+ veterans across 50 different cities to lobby members of Congress to repeal DADT and identified more than 20,000 pro-repeal veterans. We also worked with Eric Alva, an openly gay Marine and the first person injured in the Iraq War, to share his story and speak on behalf of the thousands of LGBTQ+ service members actively fighting for our country.\n**19 million** Emails to members & supporters\n**625,000** Emails to members of Congress\n**50,000** Handwritten letters\n**1,000** Grassroots lobby visits\nA Vote for Equality\n-------------------\nLeading up to a vote on repealing DADT in the Senate Armed Services Committee, HRC mobilized across six states identified as key to passing legislation through the committee.

No one could remember a President selecting a chairman over the objections of his Defense Secretary, but word came back to the Pentagon that there was no way Trump would accept just one recommendation. Two obvious contenders from the Army, however, declined to be considered: General Curtis Scaparrotti, the _NATO_ Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, told fellow-officers that there was \u201cno gas left in my tank\u201d to deal with being Trump\u2019s chairman. General Joseph Votel, the Central Command chief, also begged off, telling a colleague he was not a good fit to work so closely with Mattis.\nUrban, who had attended West Point with Trump\u2019s Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, and remained an Army man at heart, backed Mark Milley, the chief of staff of the Army. Milley, who was then sixty, was the son of a Navy corpsman who had served with the 4th Marine Division, in Iwo Jima. He grew up outside Boston and played hockey at Princeton. As an Army officer, Milley commanded troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, led the 10th Mountain Division, and oversaw the Army Forces Command. A student of history who often carried a pile of the latest books on the Second World War with him, Milley was decidedly not a member of the close-knit Marine fraternity that had dominated national-security policy for Trump\u2019s first two years. Urban told the President that he would connect better with Milley, who was loquacious and blunt to the point of being rude, and who had the Ivy League pedigree that always impressed Trump.\nMilley had already demonstrated those qualities in meetings with Trump as the Army chief of staff. \u201cMilley would go right at why it\u2019s important for the President to know this about the Army and why the Army is the service that wins all the nation\u2019s wars.

Chief among the PRC\u2019s weapons in its fight against the United States and many of its allies and partner nations are complex, unrelenting political warfare campaigns, often waged with difficult-to-recognize strategies, tactics, techniques, and procedures. This article will underscore the terms and definitions needed to understand PRC political warfare and offer a historical overview of the PRC\u2019s development of its political warfare capabilities. A solid understanding of both subjects will help American institutions and citizens alike strengthen their ability to identify, deter, counter, and defeat the PRC political warfare threat.\n**Keywords:** People\u2019s Republic of China, PRC, political warfare, Chinese Communist Party, China Dream, Xi Jinping, united front, liaison work, active measures, sharp power, smart power, propaganda, three warfares, psychological warfare, public opinion/media warfare, cyber warfare, lawfare, People\u2019s Liberation Army, PLA\nPolitical warfare is not a new phenomenon. Its practice spans thousands of years, and it is not unique to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Still, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is devilishly good at conducting its own particularly virulent form of it.

Explicit racism in law enforcement takes many forms, from membership or\n    affiliation with violent white supremacist or far-right militant groups, to engaging in racially discriminatory\n    behavior toward the public or law enforcement colleagues, to making racist remarks and sharing them on social media.\n    While it is widely acknowledged that racist officers subsist within police departments around the country, federal,\n    state, and local governments are doing far too little to proactively identify them, report their behavior to\n    prosecutors who might unwittingly rely on their testimony in criminal cases, or protect the diverse communities they\n    are sworn to serve.\nEfforts to address systemic and implicit biases in law enforcement are unlikely to be effective in reducing the\n    racial disparities in the criminal justice system as long as explicit racism in law enforcement continues to endure.\n    There is ample evidence to demonstrate that it does.\nIn 2017, the FBI reported that white supremacists posed a \u201cpersistent threat of lethal violence\u201d that has\n    produced more fatalities than any other category of domestic terrorists since 2000. footnote3_hOpncTFEnPQA3Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Homeland Security, Joint\n    Intelligence Bulletin, White Supremacist Extremism Poses Persistent Threat of Lethal Violence, May 10,\n    2017, https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3924852-White-Supremacist-Extremism-JIB.html.\n    Alarmingly, internal FBI policy documents have also warned agents assigned to domestic terrorism cases that the\n    white supremacist and anti-government militia groups they investigate often have \u201cactive links\u201d to law\n    enforcement officials. footnote4_yuasXBaNVZsk4Federal Bureau of Investigation, Counterterrorism Division,\n    Counterterrorism Policy Directive and Policy Guide, April 1, 2015 (updated November 18, 2015), 89, https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3423189/CT-Excerpt.pdf.\nThe harms that armed law enforcement officers affiliated with violent white supremacist and anti-government militia\n    groups can inflict on American society could hardly be overstated. Yet despite the FBI\u2019s acknowledgement of\n    the links between law enforcement and these suspected terrorist groups, the Justice Department has no national\n    strategy designed to identify white supremacist police officers or to protect the safety and civil rights of the\n    communities they patrol.\nObviously, only a tiny percentage of law enforcement officials are likely to be active members of white supremacist\n    groups. But one doesn\u2019t need access to secretive intelligence gathered in FBI terrorism investigations to find\n    evidence of overt and explicit racism within law enforcement. Since 2000, law enforcement officials with alleged\n    connections to white supremacist groups or far-right militant activities have been exposed in Alabama, California,\n    Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West\n    Virginia, and elsewhere. footnote5_dDOlqTjMKfFj5Becky Bratu, \u201cTwo Alabama Officers Put on Leave for Alleged Ties to\n    \u2018Hate Group,\u2019\u201d NBC News, June 17, 2015, https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/two-alabama-officers-put-leave-alleged-ties-hate-group-n377421;\n    Michael Winter, \u201cKKK Membership Sinks 2 Florida Cops,\u201d USA Today, July 14, 2014, https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/07/14/florid-police-kkk/12645555/;\n    Michelle Fox, \u201cTexas Officers Fired for Membership in KKK,\u201d ABC News, January 7, 2006, https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=93046&page=1;\n    Andy Campbell, \u201cKKK Cop Fired After Nazi Salute Photo Surfaces,\u201d Huffington Post, September 3,\n    2015, https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kkk-cop-fired-nazi-salute_n_55e885d9e4b0c818f61b24c2;\n    Angela Helm, \u201cColor Me Shocked: 2 Virginia Police Officers Fired for Ties to White Supremacist Orgs,\u201d\n    Root, April 22, 2019, https://www.theroot.com...[Content truncated]",
