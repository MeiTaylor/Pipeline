But we do need to explain it to other people who might like to know about the number that pops up in almost every Pixar film (and beyond).\nIf you have an eagle eye, you've spotted \"A113\" many, many times while watching Pixar movies. It's the license plate on Andy's mom's car in the \"Toy Story\" films. It's the forbidden code you see many times in \"Wall-E.\" It's on the camera that the diver is carrying when he captures Nemo in \"Finding Nemo.\"\n!\nThe A113 number is visible on the license plate of Andy's mom's car as Woody gets taken for a ride in \\\\\"Toy Story.\\\\\"Today\nAnd A113 goes beyond Pixar movies. You can find it in \"Avengers,\" \"Hunger Games: Catching Fire,\" \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes,\" \"The Simpsons\" and \"Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol.\" It's all around us. And obviously it's not just a really crazy coincidence. There's a reason it gets slipped into these movies.\nAnd that reason is the animators paying tribute to where they started their careers.\n\"A1-13 was the animation classroom at California Institute of the Arts in the Character Animation Program,\" John Lasseter, chief creative officer at Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios . \"Cal Arts is one of the best animation schools ... and a lot of the students ... as they created films \u2014 short films and feature films, they've kind of hidden A113 in the movies.\"\nYou can see the famous classroom in one photo of John posing with fellow animators Pete Docter and Andrew Stanton. (.)\nDirector Brad Bird (\"The Incredibles,\" \"Ratatouille\") was the first to use A113 as an Easter Egg; he put it on a car license plate in \"Family Dog,\" an animated segment from the 1987 TV series \"Amazing Stories.\"\nThe only Pixar movie without the A113 nod is \"Monsters, Inc.\" Or it might be in there and no one has spotted it yet. If you have seen it in \"Monsters, Inc.,\" please, do share your findings!\nSo if you ever spot A113 in a film you're watching, then someone who worked on it is an alumnus of Cal Arts' Animation Program and is just continuing a running gag.\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   (sms:?&body=ThestorybehindA113,mysteriousnumberineveryPixarmovieviatoday-http://www.today.com/popculture/story-behind-a113-mysterious-number-every-pix...[Content truncated]",

But no one was really interested in that in my town. You would get a lot more attention if you were the backup quarterback for a junior-college football team. That would be way more impressive than being mentored by Disney animators.\u201d\nIn a country roiled by anti-Vietnam War protests and tremendous social upheaval, animation seemed irrelevant, relegated to commercials and Saturday-morning cartoon programs for children, though animation as an art form had not been originally intended just for kids. At Disney there was even talk of shutting down the animation department altogether. Nonetheless, Walt approved the storyboards for _The Aristocats._\n\u201cSo they made the movie and it was a huge hit, and that\u2019s when they said, \u2018We can keep this going. We need some more people,\u2019 \u201d recalls Nancy Beiman, one of the first women students at CalArts and now a writer, illustrator, and professor at Sheridan College, in Oakville, Ontario. But where were the new animators going to come from?\nIn the early 30s, Disney had sent several of his animators to study at the Chouinard Art Institute, in Los Angeles, because he wanted classically trained artists, and he had maintained a keen interest in the art school. After discovering that it was having financial difficulties, he pumped money into it, and sought to include it in his grand plan for a \u201cCity of the Arts,\u201d the multi-disciplinary academy he had described to Bradbury two years before his death. After Chouinard merged with the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music, in 1961, Disney was able to realize his vision: he would build a single school devoted to the arts, incorporating Chouinard and the conservatory, and he would call it the California Institute of the Arts, nicknamed CalArts.\nMost Popular\n*   \n    Style\n    By Nate Freeman\n*   \n    Celebrity\n    By Erin Vanderhoof\n*   \n    News\n    By Katie Herchenroeder\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a lot of theorists,\u201d he explained to Thornton \u201cT.\u201d Hee, one of Disney\u2019s early animators and directors, who would end up teaching at CalArts. \u201cI...[Content truncated]",
