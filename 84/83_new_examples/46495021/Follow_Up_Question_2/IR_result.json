But we do need to explain it to other people who might like to know about the number that pops up in almost every Pixar film (and beyond).\nIf you have an eagle eye, you've spotted \"A113\" many, many times while watching Pixar movies. It's the license plate on Andy's mom's car in the \"Toy Story\" films. It's the forbidden code you see many times in \"Wall-E.\" It's on the camera that the diver is carrying when he captures Nemo in \"Finding Nemo.\"\n!\nThe A113 number is visible on the license plate of Andy's mom's car as Woody gets taken for a ride in \\\\\"Toy Story.\\\\\"Today\nAnd A113 goes beyond Pixar movies.

And obviously it's not just a really crazy coincidence. There's a reason it gets slipped into these movies.\nAnd that reason is the animators paying tribute to where they started their careers.\n\"A1-13 was the animation classroom at California Institute of the Arts in the Character Animation Program,\" John Lasseter, chief creative officer at Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios . \"Cal Arts is one of the best animation schools ... and a lot of the students ... as they created films — short films and feature films, they've kind of hidden A113 in the movies.\"\nYou can see the famous classroom in one photo of John posing with fellow animators Pete Docter and Andrew Stanton.

        "Question": "What alternative explanations exist for A113's significance in Pixar films, aside from connections to adrenochrome?",
        "Answer": "A113's significance in Pixar films can be understood through several alternative explanations that are rooted in its historical and cultural context within the animation industry, particularly its association with the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts). Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Origin as a Classroom Reference**: A113 refers to a classroom used by graphic design and character animation students at CalArts. Many renowned animators who have worked on Pixar films, including Brad Bird, Tim Burton, and Pete Docter, are alumni of this program. The inclusion of A113 as an Easter egg in films serves as a nostalgic nod to their educational roots and shared experiences at CalArts, representing a connection to their formative years in animation rather than any malicious or conspiratorial significance. This is explained in multiple sources, including [Query 2_evidence_1] and [Query 2_evidence_2].\n\n2. **Tradition of Inclusion in Animation**: The use of A113 in animated films has become a tradition among creators who have attended CalArts. This tradition is seen across various media, not just in Pixar, highlighting its role as a community in-joke among animators. For example, it appears in films like \"Toy Story\" as the license plate of Andy's mom’s car, further solidifying its origins as a playful homage rather than a coded message. The extensive documented occurrences of A113 show its prevalence as part of the creative landscape in animation, which can be further explored in detail in sources like [Query 1_evidence_1].\n\n3. **Cultural Acknowledgment in Films Beyond Pixar**: A113 has been spotted in a wide range of films and TV shows beyond Pixar, indicating that its usage is not exclusive to a specific narrative or set of themes. For instance, it also appears in movie franchises like \"Avengers\" and \"Mission: Impossible,\" which shows that it serves as a way for animators and filmmakers to acknowledge and celebrate their connections to their alma mater. This broader recognition reinforces the idea that it symbolizes camaraderie among filmmakers rather than a hidden meaning linked to adrenochrome, as discussed in [Query 2_evidence_2].\n\nOverall, the concept of A113 in Pixar and various other animations is one of homage and community heritage, distinctly separate from any conspiratorial interpretations.",
