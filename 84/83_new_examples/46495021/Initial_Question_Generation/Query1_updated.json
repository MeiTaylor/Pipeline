In 2020, we too are beset with plague, rampant , and a persistent rumor that \u201cglobal elites\u201d torture children to harvest the chemical adrenochrome from their blood, which they then inject in order to stay healthy and young.\nA favorite topic of interconnected  and  conspiracy communities, so-called \u201cadrenochrome harvesting\u201d long predates these groups. It has, however, resurrected during the Covid-19 pandemic. Google Trends shows  in searches for adrenochrome in March and June of 2020. It\u2019s prevalent on , , and .

Blending academic research and open-source intelligence techniques, Friedberg is an investigative ethnographer, focusing on the impacts that alternative media, anonymous communities, and unpopular cultures have on political communication and organization.\nThe adrenochrome harvesting conspiracy theory is a potent example of \u201chidden virality\u201d and the ways in which unpopular culture animate social media platforms outside of the mainstream view. Named by researchers , hidden virality describes dominant content in specific pockets of the internet that are largely unseen by journalists and mass audiences, making them difficult for social media companies to identify and act upon. The impact of hidden virality can\u2019t be stopped by retroactively banning a few thousand Twitter accounts; it is an iterative, memetic phenomenon that outpaces terms of service. Even with early intervention by  and recent movements by ,  and  to crack down on QAnon, adrenochrome harvesting remains a mainstream conversation for some online communities.\n spread virally alongside hoaxes and disinformation.

Social media users have now related this term to the commonly seen number in many Pixas movies, A113.
