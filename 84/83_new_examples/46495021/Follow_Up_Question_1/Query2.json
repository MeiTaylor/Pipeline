The third, and final instance, is the sky above the trailer where Randall gets beaten up. The stars can be connected to read \"A113\".\n23 Finding Nemo\n---------------\n!\nWhile it seems hard to include an Easter egg underwater, 2003's _Finding Nemo_ found a way to creative way to deliver. While hard to find at first glance, it can be spotted as the model number on a camera used by a scuba driver.\n22 The Incredibles\n------------------\n!\nPixar's sixth movie, _The Incredibles_, came out in 2004 and boasted several A113 call-outs. The first of which was the room number of a conference room in Syndrome's lair, where Mr. Incredible is waiting to get his second assignment before being attacked by the Omnidroid. The second instance is quite creative, as the prison level that Mr. Incredible is being held on is \"Level A1\" and the cell number is 13. The jet hanger that the family ends up in looks like it reads A113 on the wall, as well.\n21 Cars\n-------\n!\nThe 2006 Pixar film, _Cars_, incorporated A113 in three very natural ways. The first of which was having it be the goofy tow truck, Mater's license plate number. There is also a train that Lightning McQueen thinks is Mack that reads \"A113\" on the front. Additionally, the Easter egg is a part of Dexter Hoover's license plate with the whole thing reading \"A113CA\".\n20 Ratatouille\n--------------\n!\nSimilar to its predecessor, 2007's _Ratatouille_ had multiple inclusions of A113. One of which was a tag that read \"A113\" on a lab rat named Git's left ear. The other was when Linguini was seen watching TV, A113 was written on a train behind the on-screen couple.\n19 Wall-E\n---------\n!\n_Wall-E_ came out in 2008 and marked the first and only time that A113 was made a part of the central plot. In the movie, A113 is the forbidden code for AUTO's directive. In Leet Speak, Wall-E is WA113, serving as another interesting Easter egg. A113 can also be seen on the 4K/Blu-ray release cover.\n18 Up\n-----\n!\nOne of the most heart-w...[Content truncated]",
