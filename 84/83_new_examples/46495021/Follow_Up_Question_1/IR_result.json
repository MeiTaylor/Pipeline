But we do need to explain it to other people who might like to know about the number that pops up in almost every Pixar film (and beyond).\nIf you have an eagle eye, you've spotted \"A113\" many, many times while watching Pixar movies. It's the license plate on Andy's mom's car in the \"Toy Story\" films. It's the forbidden code you see many times in \"Wall-E.\" It's on the camera that the diver is carrying when he captures Nemo in \"Finding Nemo.\"\n!\nThe A113 number is visible on the license plate of Andy's mom's car as Woody gets taken for a ride in \\\\\"Toy Story.\\\\\"Today\nAnd A113 goes beyond Pixar movies. You can find it in \"Avengers,\" \"Hunger Games: Catching Fire,\" \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes,\" \"The Simpsons\" and \"Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol.\" It's all around us. And obviously it's not just a really crazy coincidence. There's a reason it gets slipped into these movies.\nAnd that reason is the animators paying tribute to where they started their careers.\n\"A1-13 was the animation classroom at California Institute of the Arts in the Character Animation Program,\" John L...[Content truncated]",

The third, and final instance, is the sky above the trailer where Randall gets beaten up. The stars can be connected to read \"A113\".\n23 Finding Nemo\n---------------\n!\nWhile it seems hard to include an Easter egg underwater, 2003's _Finding Nemo_ found a way to creative way to deliver. While hard to find at first glance, it can be spotted as the model number on a camera used by a scuba driver.\n22 The Incredibles\n------------------\n!\nPixar's sixth movie, _The Incredibles_, came out in 2004 and boasted several A113 call-outs. The first of which was the room number of a conference room in Syndrome's lair, where Mr. Incredible is waiting to get his second assignment before being attacked by the Omnidroid. The second instance is quite creative, as the prison level that Mr. Incredible is being held on is \"Level A1\" and the cell number is 13. The jet hanger that the family ends up in looks like it reads A113 on the wall, as well.\n21 Cars\n-------\n!\nThe 2006 Pixar film, _Cars_, incorporated A113 in three very natural ways. The first of which was having it be the goofy tow truck, Mater's license plate number. There is also a train that Lightning McQueen thinks is Mack that reads \"A113\" on the front. Additionally, the Easter egg is a part of Dexter Hoover's license plate with the whole thing reading \"A113CA\".\n20 Ratatouille\n--------------\n!\nSimilar to its predecessor, 2007's _Ratatouille_ had multiple inclusions of A113. One of which was a tag that read \"A113\" on a lab rat named Git's left ear. The other was when Linguini was seen watching TV, A113 was written on a train behind the on-screen couple.\n19 Wall-E\n---------\n!\n_Wall-E_ came out in 2008 and marked the first and only time that A113 was made a part of the central plot. In the movie, A113 is the forbidden code for AUTO's directive. In Leet Speak, Wall-E is WA113, serving as another interesting Easter egg.

        "Question": "What are the origins and meanings of A113 in animation beyond conspiracy theories?",
        "Answer": "The origins and meanings of \"A113\" in animation, especially beyond conspiracy theories, stem primarily from its roots at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts). Here’s a detailed explanation:\n\n1. **CalArts Classroom Reference**: A113 refers to a classroom at CalArts that was used by graphic design and character animation students. This room number has become a symbol among alumni, serving as a nostalgic homage to their education and shared experiences. Almost every Pixar movie includes A113 as a nod to their alma mater, highlighting its significance as a cultural reference within the animation community. Notable alumni such as Brad Bird, Tim Burton, and current Pixar chief Pete Docter have perpetuated this reference in their works. Consequently, A113 represents a meaningful connection to the artists' educational background rather than a sinister or conspiratorial meaning.\n\n2. **Tradition in Animated Films**: The use of A113 has become a tradition in animated films, not just at Pixar but across various media. For example, it appears in Pixar classics like \"Toy Story\" (as Andy's mom’s license plate) and in other animated works such as \"The Brave Little Toaster.\" This tradition showcases how creators signal their connections to CalArts, reinforcing A113 as an inside joke rather than a secret code.\n\n3. **Broader Recognition in Film and Television**: A113's usage serves as an Easter egg in various films and TV shows, promoting a sense of community and shared heritage among animators and filmmakers. Its prevalence further underscores its benign status as a tribute rather than anything ominous. This tradition of integrating A113 into creative works reflects the camaraderie and collaboration that exists within the animation industry, promoting bonds among past and present animators.",
