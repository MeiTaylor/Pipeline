We don't need to explain it to you. But we do need to explain it to other people who might like to know about the number that pops up in almost every Pixar film (and beyond).\nIf you have an eagle eye, you've spotted \"A113\" many, many times while watching Pixar movies. It's the license plate on Andy's mom's car in the \"Toy Story\" films. It's the forbidden code you see many times in \"Wall-E.\" It's on the camera that the diver is carrying when he captures Nemo in \"Finding Nemo.\"\n!\nThe A113 number is visible on the license plate of Andy's mom's car as Woody gets taken for a ride in \\\\\"Toy Story.\\\\\"Today\nAnd A113 goes beyond Pixar movies. You can find it in \"Avengers,\" \"Hunger Games: Catching Fire,\" \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes,\" \"The Simpsons\" and \"Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol.\" It's all around us. And obviously it's not just a really crazy coincidence. There's a reason it gets slipped into these movies.\nAnd that reason is the animators paying tribute to where they started their careers.\n\"A1-13 was the animation classroom at California Institute of the Arts in the Character Animation Program,\" John L...[Content truncated]",

While the A113 references in Pixar movies predate Bird's work with the studio, A113 references predate those in Pixar movies. In fact, according to , Bird was the originator of A113 as an Easter egg in the first place.\nThe first example of A113 being referenced on screen is during an episode of the anthology series \"Amazing Stories,\" which was created by Steven Spielberg and ran on NBC from 1985 to 1987. Bird co-wrote aÂ Season 1 episode before returning in Season 2 with \"Family Dog\"Â â later spun off into its own short-lived seriesÂ â which he wrote, directed, and voiced the titular canine. It was during that episode that A113 got its debut as an Easter egg when it was used as a license plate number, which remains one of its most common uses to this day.\nA113 is also referenced literally every time Bird tweets â it's part of his .\nIt made its movie debut in The Brave Little Toaster\n---------------------------------------------------\n  !Walt Disney Pictures\nBetween its journey from television to \"Toy Story,\"Â A113 had already had its big screen debut elsewhere. The code appeared on a door in the 1987 animated film \"The Brave Little Toaster,\" which might not be a Pixar movie but was worked on by several key figures who would soon play a major role in that studio. For starters, it was co-written by Joe Ranft, who has story and/or screenwriter credits on \"Toy Story,\" \"A Bug's Life,\" and \"Cars.\" It was also the first CGI film ever pitched by a certain John Lasseter, director of the first three Pixar films and executive producer on many others ().\n\"The Brave Little Toaster\" ended up being traditionally animated instead, with \"Toy Story\" eventually earning the distinction of the first fully computer-animated feature film. After Lasseter was fired following his CGI pitch for \"Toaster,\" he ended up being one of the founders of Pixar, and the rest is history. In many ways, \"The Brave Little Toaster\" wound up paving the way for Pixar's future â not to mention the fact that \"Toy Story\" borrowed the concept of inanimate objects that come to life in the absence of humans from \"Toaster.\" So the latter being the first movie to use A113 prior to it becoming a...[Content truncated]",
