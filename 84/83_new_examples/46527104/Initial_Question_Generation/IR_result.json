        "Question": "Is the video genuinely depicting Jack Fischer during a spacewalk, as claimed?",
        "Answer": "Yes, the video is genuinely depicting NASA astronaut Jack Fischer during a spacewalk, as claimed. Here are the reasons supporting this conclusion:\n\n1. **Confirmed Participation in Spacewalks**: Jack Fischer participated in a notable spacewalk on May 12, 2017, which was the 200th spacewalk for the International Space Station. During this spacewalk, he and his colleague, astronaut Peggy Whitson, performed various tasks outside the station, which aligns with the activities depicted in the video [Query 1_evidence_1].\n\n2. **Visual Documentation**: The video features an astronaut in a white spacesuit and performing tasks outside the International Space Station, such as manipulating equipment or interacting with components. This matches descriptions of Fischer's activities during his own spacewalk. He was specifically working on installations and repairs similar to what is visually represented in the video [Query 1_evidence_2].\n\n3. **Credible Source**: The video was shared on the NASA Johnson Twitter account, which indicates its credibility as an official source from NASA, further supporting the claim that it portrays Fischer during a spacewalk [Video_information].\n\nBased on this analysis of the evidence, I am confident in my answer (90%). The documentation of Fischer's participation in the specific spacewalk and the official nature of the video's source strongly lend credibility to the claim that the video genuinely depicts him during a spacewalk.",
