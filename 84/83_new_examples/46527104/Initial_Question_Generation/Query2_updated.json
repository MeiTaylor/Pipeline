Live coverage of the milestone event will begin in the stream above around 6:30AM ET, with the spacewalk itself scheduled to start 8AM and continue for six and a half hours.\nFor Fischer (wearing the space suit with no stripes), it will be a new experience \u2014 it\u2019s his first ever spacewalk. But for Whitson, the commander on the current (and 51st) expedition to the ISS, it\u2019ll be a familiar job. She holds the record for the most spacewalks by a female US astronaut, and today\u2019s outing will be her ninth. The 57-year-old Whitson has also spent more days off the planet than any other woman (more than 500 days in total) and will be recognizable by the red stripes on her space suit.\nThe pair have a few different repairs to carry out while trussed to the exterior of the ISS. These include replacing a large avionics box that supplies electricity and data connections for various onboard science experiments, and installing a fabric shield designed to protect against micrometeorites on one of the spacecraft\u2019s pressurized mating adapters. These adapters help connect different modules of the ISS. The one being worked on today, PMA-3, is currently installed on the Harmony module, where it will be used to host a new docking port for commercial crewed spacecraft arriving at the ISS.\nFor Whiston, today\u2019s spacewalk also involves a little bit of unfinished business, albeit of the rather unglamorous kind. The fabric shield she and Fischer will be installing is a replacement for one that Whitson . The shield is about two inches thick and measures about five feet by two feet. It\u2019s part of an array of measures that protect the ISS against space debris, ensuring that the events of 2013 film _Gravity_ don\u2019t play out in real life.\n0 Comments / 0 New\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\n1....[Content truncated]",

Media interested in participating by telephone must call the Johnson newsroom at 281-483-5111 no later than 1:45 p.m. on the day of the briefing.\nExpedition 53 Commander Randy Bresnik of NASA will lead all three spacewalks, joined on Oct. 5 and 10 by Flight Engineer Mark Vande Hei, also of NASA. Flight Engineer Joe Acaba of NASA will join Bresnik on Oct. 18 for the third spacewalk.\nDuring the first spacewalk, Bresnik and Vande Hei will replace one of two Latching End Effectors (LEE) on the station\u2019s robotic arm, Canadarm2. One of the Canadarm2 grappling mechanisms experienced a stall of its motorized latches last month, but the problem has had no effect on planned station operations. A spare LEE is stored outside on the station\u2019s truss. Canadarm2 has two identical Latching End Effectors used to grapple visiting cargo vehicles and payloads, provide data and telemetry to the rest of the Canadian-built Mobile Base System and the unique capability to \u201cwalk\u201d from one location on the station\u2019s truss to another.\nThe second and third spacewalks will be devoted to lubricating the newly replaced\u00a0Canadarm2\u00a0end effector\u00a0and replacing cameras on the left side of the station\u2019s truss and the right side of the station\u2019s U.S. Destiny laboratory.\nThe spacewalks will be the third, fourth and fifth of Bresnik\u2019s career and the third for Acaba.

This connection will be used from 2018, when a new thermal cooling system for the AMS silicon tracker is put into place.\nThe AMS cooling pump system was developed by the collaboration at CERN, and a similar system is now also used by some of the  to cool their trackers. Despite only needing one pump, AMS was flown to space with four. Now, three of the four pumps are no longer functioning and so multiple spacewalks are planned for 2018 to replace these with a new cooling system, which would extend the life of AMS in space by 12 years.\nAMS was launched in 2011 on\u00a0the penultimate flight of...[Content truncated]",

Fischer (Colonel, U.S. Air Force) was selected by NASA in July 2009.

During his 2017 mission, he logged 136 days in space with two spacewalks. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Astronautical Engineering from the U.S. Air Force Academy, and a Master of Science in Aeronautics and Astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Colonel Fischer is an Air Force Command pilot with over 3,000 flight hours in more than 45 types of aircraft.\u00a0While he was onboard the ISS last year, Colonel Fischer supported and helped operate several experiments from\u00a0\u00a0Space Technologies in the \u00a0department.\nJack Fischer RSVP\n-----------------\nRegistration is now closed.
