Although the database contains many examples of online usage and shared graphics, another feature that makes it unique is its emphasis on real world examples of hate symbols—showing them as extremists actually use them: on signs and \nclothing, graffiti and jewelry, and even on their own bodies as tattoos and brands. Readers of this document and users of the Hate on Display database should be aware that this database, by its nature, contains racist and anti-Semitic imagery and language that some may find offensive. No one who encounters one of the symbols listed in this database should rush to judgment. All symbols depicted here must be evaluated carefully in the context in which they appear. Few symbols represent just one idea or are used exclusively by one group. For example, the Confederate Flag is a symbol that is frequently used by white supremacists, but which also has \nbeen used by people and groups that are not necessarily racist. Similarly, other symbols in this database may be used in \ncertain contexts by people who are not extreme or racist.

HAS SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING OUT A DIVERSITY OF FAR-RIGHT GROUPS RANGING FROM WHITE NATIONALISTS TO ARMED “PATRIOT” GROUPS.\nWhat follows is a guide to some of the flags and symbols as spotted by Hatewatch analysts: \nThe above is a poster for the Charlottesville “Unite the Right” rally derived from Benjamin Franklin’s famous “Join, or Die” cartoon.\nThe groups depicted include from left to right (K) “Kekistani,” (AC) “Anti-Communist,” (L) “Libertarian,” (N) “Nationalist,” (I) “Identitarian/Identity Evropa,” (SN) “Southern Nationalist,” (NS) “National Socialist,” and (AR) “Alt Right.” The National Socialist flags depicted include Traditionalist Worker Party and Vanguard America.\n‘National flag of Kekistan’\nThe “national flag of Kekistan” mimics a German Nazi war flag, with the Kek logo replacing the swastika and the green replacing the infamous German red. A 4chan logo is emblazoned in the upper left hand corner. Alt-righters are particularly fond of the way the banner trolls liberals who recognize its origins.\nFASCIST/NATIONAL SOCIALIST FLAGS\nNational Socialist Movement\nThe oldest and most likely largest NS group in the U.S. Run by Jeff Schoep.\nRoman Legion Flag\nFlag depicting an eagle holding a fasces standing inside of a laurel wreath. Each of these symbols have been adopted by various elements of the far right.\nSchwarze Sonne (Black Sun)\nSometimes called the sonnerad, the Black Sun symbol has become synonymous with myriad far-right groups who traffic in neo-Nazi and/or neo-Volkisch ideologies. The symbol is based on the ancient sun wheel artifacts that were made and used by Norse and Germanic tribes as symbol of their pagan beliefs. Those sun wheels, made centuries upon centuries ago, do not usually resemble the complexity of this particular version. The version above is inlayed into the marble floor of the Castle Wewelsburg, the castle that Himmler made the spiritual and literal home of the SS during the reign of the Third Reich, and has significance within the occult practices of the SS.\nTraditionalist Worker Party\nA white nationalist group that advocates for racially pure nations and communities and blames Jews for many of the world’s problems. Even as it claims to oppose racism, saying every race deserves its own lands and culture, the group is intimately allied with neo-Nazi and other hardline racist organizations that espouse unvarnished white supremacist views.\nTraditionalist Youth...[Content truncated]"

    "QA": {
        "Question": "What identifiable symbols or logos on the vests differentiate these individuals from non-extremist groups?",
        "Answer": "Based on the information provided and the analysis of the identifiable symbols or logos on the vests seen in the video, we can conclude that the individuals in the video may be associated with neo-Nazi or white supremacist groups due to the following reasons: 1. **Use of Hate Symbols**: Many extremist groups utilize specific symbols that are commonly recognized as associated with hate or white supremacy. The identified insignia on the individuals' vests, similar to those documented in hate symbols databases, could include variations of known hate symbols such as the Black Sun, the Othala Rune, or SS bolts which are widely adopted by neo-Nazi groups. For instance, the Black Sun symbol has become synonymous with far-right ideologies and is frequently observed at neo-Nazi gatherings. 2. **Organizational Attire**: The video describes the individuals as wearing vests adorned with circular logos, which is characteristic of organized groups, including extremist organizations. Attire that is coordinated and bears identifiable symbols suggests a collective identity, typically found within extremist groups who represent racial or ideological agendas. Uniforms or cohesion in dress can be compared to other extremist rallies where such attire is intended to convey solidarity and affiliation with a particular ideology. 3. **Historical Context**: The frequency and context of reported incidents involving neo-Nazi groups signify that gatherings containing individuals dressed in a specific manner—and potentially displaying hate symbols—are often aimed at promoting extremist ideologies. Given that there have been numerous reports on gatherings involving neo-Nazi elements in similar contexts, the presence of identifiable symbols or logos on their vests could align with patterns observed in other documented events involving hate groups. In conclusion, based on the identifiable symbols and attire described in the video, along with their alignment with documented hate symbols and patterns of extremist behaviors, it is reasonable to conclude that these individuals are likely distinguishing themselves from non-extremist groups.",
