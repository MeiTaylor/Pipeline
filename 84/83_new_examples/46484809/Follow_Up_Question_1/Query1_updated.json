While it is widely acknowledged that racist officers subsist within police departments around the country, federal, state, and local governments are doing far too little to proactively identify them, report their behavior to prosecutors who might unwittingly rely on their testimony in criminal cases, or protect the diverse communities they are sworn to serve.\nEfforts to address systemic and implicit biases in law enforcement are unlikely to be effective in reducing the racial disparities in the criminal justice system as long as explicit racism in law enforcement continues to endure. There is ample evidence to demonstrate that it does.\nIn 2017, the FBI reported that white supremacists posed a \u201cpersistent threat of lethal violence\u201d that has produced more fatalities than any other category of domestic terrorists since 2000. Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Homeland Security, Joint Intelligence Bulletin, _White Supremacist Extremism Poses Persistent Threat of Lethal Violence_, May 10, 2017,  Alarmingly, internal FBI policy documents have also warned agents assigned to domestic terrorism cases that the white supremacist and anti-government militia groups they investigate often have \u201cactive links\u201d to law enforcement officials. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Counterterrorism Division, _Counterterrorism Policy Directive and Policy Guide_, April 1, 2015 (updated November 18, 2015), 89, .\nThe harms that armed law enforcement officers affiliated with violent white supremacist and anti-government militia groups can inflict on American society could hardly be overstated. Yet despite the FBI\u2019s acknowledgement of the links between law enforcement and these suspected terrorist groups, the Justice Department has no national strategy designed to identify white supremacist police officers or to protect the safety and civil rights of the communities they patrol.\nObviously, only a tiny percentage of law enforcement officials are likely to be active members of white supremacist groups. But one doesn\u2019t need access to secretive intelligence gathered in FBI terrorism investigations to find evidence of overt and explicit racism within law enforcement. Since 2000, law enforcement officials with alleged connections to white supremacist groups or far-right militant activities have been exposed in Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and elsewhere.
