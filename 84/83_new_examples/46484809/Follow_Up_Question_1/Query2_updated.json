While it is widely acknowledged that racist officers subsist within police departments around the country, federal, state, and local governments are doing far too little to proactively identify them, report their behavior to prosecutors who might unwittingly rely on their testimony in criminal cases, or protect the diverse communities they are sworn to serve.\nEfforts to address systemic and implicit biases in law enforcement are unlikely to be effective in reducing the racial disparities in the criminal justice system as long as explicit racism in law enforcement continues to endure. There is ample evidence to demonstrate that it does.\nIn 2017, the FBI reported that white supremacists posed a \u201cpersistent threat of lethal violence\u201d that has produced more fatalities than any other category of domestic terrorists since 2000. Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Homeland Security, Joint Intelligence Bulletin, _White Supremacist Extremism Poses Persistent Threat of Lethal Violence_, May 10, 2017,  Alarmingly, internal FBI policy documents have also warned agents assigned to domestic terrorism cases that the white supremacist and anti-government militia groups they investigate often have \u201cactive links\u201d to law enforcement officials. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Counterterrorism Division, _Counterterrorism Policy Directive and Policy Guide_, April 1, 2015 (updated November 18, 2015), 89, .\nThe harms that armed law enforcement officers affiliated with violent white supremacist and anti-government militia groups can inflict on American society could hardly be overstated. Yet despite the FBI\u2019s acknowledgement of the links between law enforcement and these suspected terrorist groups, the Justice Department has no national strategy designed to identify white supremacist police officers or to protect the safety and civil rights of the communities they patrol.\nObviously, only a tiny percentage of law enforcement officials are likely to be active members of white supremacist groups. But one doesn\u2019t need access to secretive intelligence gathered in FBI terrorism investigations to find evidence of overt and explicit racism within law enforcement. Since 2000, law enforcement officials with alleged connections to white supremacist groups or far-right militant activities have been exposed in Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and elsewhere.

White nationalists displaying Nazi symbols, brawling, and someone purposely driving a car into a crowd are all upsetting. As a scholar of social movements and the politics of race, I\u2019ve also noticed some issues worth highlighting that have not been such a major part of the discussions. These include noticing the impact of the specific tactical choices the White Nationalists are making, and the specific tactical dilemmas faced by their opponents.\n!\nCharlottesville White nationalists\nWhat struck me most powerfully about the White Nationalists in Charlotte is their use of Nazi symbolism and their overt Antisemitism. I know from what I\u2019ve read that neo-Nazi groups have been on the rise for some time, but I was struck by the apparent tactical misstep in using overt Nazi symbolism. Evoking the Nazis and attacking Jews, not just Blacks or immigrants, brought them a much wider range of negative response than they would have received even with only KKK imagery, much less more muted \u201cWhite heritage\u201d or White victimization images. There has been much less public outrage over past incidents of White nationalists carrying assault rifles, engaging in armed standoffs with police, and attacking and even killing minorities. White nationalists have bombed buildings and driven cars into crowds before, and even these horrific acts evoked less response. It sure seems it was the Nazi symbols\u2013not just the Swastik...[Content truncated]",

In February, I began to take the long way home to avoid the swastika that was freshly painted on my own building. The paint was red like the blood of history.\nWhat do these symbols mean, though? What are the ideas promoted by the people who paint them? What does the all but complete lack of response from political figures, law enforcement, and community members imply about Bulgarian society? Of course, my research into these issues has necessarily been shallow, both because it is outside of the scope of my project and because learning the Bulgarian language has been a great struggle for me, which would impede both textual research and field interviews. But in my free time, the nights and bits of weekends when I am not occupied with my primary studies, these questions have become almost an obsession.\nI think it was November when I saw the first swastika. It was black and painted atop a red heart in the midst of several other graffiti slogans. Retrospectively, it seems a bit incredible that I didn\u2019t notice other swastikas earlier.

The initial event, which was heavily promoted and encouraged by President Trump, gave all of these groups something to rally around.\n\u201cThis was an event designed to oppose the results of a free and fair democratic election and the transition of power that would naturally follow,\u201d Mark Pitcavage, a historian and expert in extremism with the Anti-Defamation League said.\nCNN spoke with him to identify the symbols and understand the chilling messages of tyranny, white supremacy, anarchy, racism, anti-Semitism and hatred they portray.\nNoose and gallows\n-----------------\n!\nCNN Illustrations/Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\nWhile a noose on its own is often used as a form of racial intimidation, Pitcavage says he believes in this context the gallows were to suggest punishment for committing treason. \u201cIt is suggesting that representatives and senators who vote to certify the election results, and possibly Vice President Pence, are committing treason and should be tried and hanged,\u201d he explains.\nThat treason rhetoric was seen on right-wing message boards in days leading up to the event.\nThree Percenters flag\n---------------------\n!\nCNN Illustrations/Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images\nThe Three Percenters (also known as III%ers, 3%ers or Threepers) are part of the militia movement in the United States and are anti-government extremists, according to the ADL.\nLike others in the militia movement, Three Percenters view themselves as defending the American people against government tyranny.\n\u201cBecause many adherents to the militia movement strongly support President Trump, in recent years, Three Percenters have not been as active in opposing the federal government, directing their ire at other perceived foes, including leftists/antifa, Muslims and immigrants,\u201d \nThe group\u2019s name comes from an inaccurate claim that only three percent of the people in the colonies armed themselves and fought against the British during the Revolutionary War.\nThe flag seen above is their logo on the traditional Betsy Ross flag. Pitcavage says right-wing groups (mainstream or extreme), which think of themselves as patriotic, sometimes co-opt America\u2019s first flag.\n**\u201cRelease the Kraken\u201d flag**\nThe flag references former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell\u2019s comments that she was going to \u201crelease the Kraken.\u201d  that would destroy the idea that Joe Biden won the presidency.\nThe \u201cKraken,\u201d a mammoth sea creature from Scandavian folklore, has turned into a meme in circles that believe the election was stolen. The Kraken, they say, is a cache of evidence that there was widespread fraud.

CONTEMPORARY MANIFESTATIONS OF VIOLENT RIGHT -WING EXTREMISM IN THE EU: \n> 4\n# Introduction \nRight -wing violence is rising across the EU, illustrating the need for adequate measures to prevent and \ncounter the threat. Yet, many existing preventing and countering violent extremism (P/CVE) measures hav e\nbeen developed around Islamist extremism or in response to the wave of violent right -wing extremism \n(VRWE) three decades ago. \nThis paper explores whether measures to deal with previous right -wing extremist expressions are fit to \ncounter current manifesta tions of right -wing extremism. It describes the modern (violent) right -wing extremist \nscene and how it has evolved from past manifestations. It also highlights a number of promising practices \nfrom previous programmes targeting right -wing violence. Several core concepts of these approaches remain \nhighly valuable today. However, a more diverse \u201cat -risk\u201d group, increasing internationalisation and online \npresence demand for supplementary measures and a rethink of some aspects. \n# Violent r ight -wing extremism in Eu rope \n# The main ideological currents \nRight -wing extremism is far from forming...[Content truncated]",
