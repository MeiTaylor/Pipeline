Based on a CSIS data set of terrorist incidents, the most significant threat likely comes from white supremacists, though anarchists and religious extremists inspired by the Islamic State and al-Qaeda could present a potential threat as well. Over the rest of 2020, the terrorist threat in the United States will likely rise based on several factors, including the November 2020 presidential election._\n* * *\nOn June 3, 2020, federal authorities arrested three individuals allegedly associated with the “boogaloo” movement, a loosely-organized group of extremists preparing for a civil war, for conspiring to cause violence in Las Vegas and possessing an improvised incendiary device.1 Less than a week later, law enforcement officials near Richmond, VA, arrested Harry H. Rogers, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, for driving a vehicle into peaceful protesters. Around the same time, members of a Brooklyn anarchist group urged its supporters to conduct “rebellion” against the government.2 Extremists from all sides flooded social media with disinformation, conspiracy theories, and incitements to violence in response to the protests following the death of George Floyd, swamping Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and other platforms.3\nThis CSIS brief examines the state of terrorism in the United States. It asks two sets of questions. First, what are the most significant types of terrorism in the United States, and how has the terrorism threat in the U.S. homeland evolved over time? Second, what are the implications for terrorism over the next year? To answer these questions, this analysis compiles and analyzes an original data set of 893 terrorist plots and attacks in the United States between January 1994 and May 2020.\nThis analysis makes several arguments. First, far-right terrorism has significantly outpaced terrorism from other types of perpetrators, including from far-left networks and individuals inspired by the Islamic State and al-Qaeda. Right-wing attacks and plots account for the majority of all terrorist incidents in the United States since 1994, and the total number of right-wing attacks and plots has grown significantly during the past six years. Right-wing extremists perpetrated two thirds of the attacks and plots in the United States in 2019 and over 90 percent between January 1 and May 8, 2020. Second, terrorism in the United States will likely increase over the next year in response to several factors. One of...[Content truncated]",

In 2020, the final year of Donald Trump’s presidency, events in which Proud Boys showed support for Trump, for instance by demonstrating in favor of him or by attacking anti-Trump demonstrators, constituted more than half of all Proud Boys activity. Although demonstrations supporting former President Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud continued after he left office, this figure subsided in 2021 as new issues began to dominate the far-right scene. By 2022, while the group remained roughly as active as in prior years, pro-Trump events had declined to just over 12% of the group’s activity.\n!(blob:https://acleddata.com/e0c46ac6a432826aa7e925a4d2a85c7c)\nSimilarly, the Proud Boys rarely mobilized around the issue of abortion prior to a sudden spike in spring 2022. In the three months following the May 2022 leak of the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down Roe v. Wade, the group participated in roughly the same number of abortion-related demonstrations as it had in the previous two years combined. The surge in abortion-related activity quickly fell off shortly thereafter: ultimately, the Proud Boys took part in more anti-abortion demonstrations in the first two months after the decision was leaked than in all the months since combined.\nMore recently, coinciding with a wave of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation introduced across the country,6 the Proud Boys have shifted their efforts to anti-LGBTQ+ mobilization. During the first 11 months of 2023, engagement in anti-LGBTQ+ events accounted for roughly 73% of all demonstrations involving the Proud Boys, compared to 42% in 2022, which had also seen a significant increase from just 8% in 2021. This shows a dramatic evolution in the group’s focus: in 2020, anti-LGBTQ+ demonstrations represented a tiny fraction of the Proud Boys’ participation in events, at less than 1% of their total demonstration activity.\nOpportunistic Collaboration with Other Far-Right Groups\n-------------------------------------------------------\nRelationships between the Proud Boys and other far-right groups have evolved as they ride the wave of far-right political trends. The Proud Boys have appeared alongside a variety of different actors during rallies, largely depending on which groups have interests that converge with their own. Christian activists and Republican Party officials are among the most frequent actors to join events involving the Proud Boys, with their presence being reported in 12% and 10% of total recorded events, respectively.

While it is widely acknowledged that racist officers subsist within police departments around the country, federal, state, and local governments are doing far too little to proactively identify them, report their behavior to prosecutors who might unwittingly rely on their testimony in criminal cases, or protect the diverse communities they are sworn to serve.\nEfforts to address systemic and implicit biases in law enforcement are unlikely to be effective in reducing the racial disparities in the criminal justice system as long as explicit racism in law enforcement continues to endure. There is ample evidence to demonstrate that it does.\nIn 2017, the FBI reported that white supremacists posed a “persistent threat of lethal violence” that has produced more fatalities than any other category of domestic terrorists since 2000. Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Homeland Security, Joint Intelligence Bulletin, _White Supremacist Extremism Poses Persistent Threat of Lethal Violence_, May 10, 2017,  Alarmingly, internal FBI policy documents have also warned agents assigned to domestic terrorism cases that the white supremacist and anti-government militia groups they investigate often have “active links” to law enforcement officials. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Counterterrorism Division, _Counterterrorism Policy Directive and Policy Guide_, April 1, 2015 (updated November 18, 2015), 89, .\nThe harms that armed law enforcement officers affiliated with violent white supremacist and anti-government militia groups can inflict on American society could hardly be overstated. Yet despite the FBI’s acknowledgement of the links between law enforcement and these suspected terrorist groups, the Justice Department has no national strategy designed to identify white supremacist police officers or to protect the safety and civil rights of the communities they patrol.\nObviously, only a tiny percentage of law enforcement officials are likely to be active members of white supremacist groups. But one doesn’t need access to secretive intelligence gathered in FBI terrorism investigations to find evidence of overt and explicit racism within law enforcement. Since 2000, law enforcement officials with alleged connections to white supremacist groups or far-right militant activities have been exposed in Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and elsewhere.

But then came Charlottesville, and the movement was knocked back on its heels. Still, Trump's rhetoric and the country's changing demographics continue to buoy the movement.\nIf 2016 was the year of white supremacists being electrified by the rise of Donald Trump, his inauguration in January sent them into a frenzy. They believed they finally had a sympathizer in the White House and an administration that would enact policies to match their anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim and racist ideas.\nThroughout the year, Trump thrilled and comforted them with his apparent kinship and pugilistic style, his refusal to condemn hate crimes committed in his name and his outrageous statements equating neo-Nazis and anti-racist activists after the deadly violence in Charlottesville.\nTrump’s brand of nationalism wasn’t just a U.S. phenomenon. Far-right populist movements were on a global tear, first with Brexit in 2016 and then with nationalist parties seeing hefty gains in political power across Europe.\n----------------------------------------\n!\nPresident Trump shows his signature on the controversial travel ban in January 2017. The ban initially sought to block visitors to the United States from Iran, Iraq, Libyia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, for 90 days.\nPolls made it clear that certain voters, particularly those uncomfortable with immigration and the demographic change that comes with it, supported Trump because of his racist views, even when they were not suffering from economic anxiety. This core of hard-right voters threw its support behind political candidates like the overtly pro-Confederate Corey Stewart, who nearly...[Content truncated]",

Members spend a great deal of time defining and arguing about these terms as well as spreading them into mainstream society by trying to insert them into mass media.\nBlack is pointing to a central tactic in the political strategy of white nationalists and white supremacists. They understand that their cause is not widely popular and that they are losing the battles of ideas and demography. This reality pushes them to try to smuggle their ideas into mainstream dialogue by exploiting so-called fellow travelers and political opportunists. Recently, the movement has had notable success, particularly among American and European politicians who are exploiting fear for electoral ends. Matteo Salvini, the federal secretary of the Italian Northern League party and former deputy prime minister, called for closing the nation’s borders against the dangers of an Islamic invasion7; Victor Orbán aims to “keep Hungary as Hungary” by building a fence to keep immigrants out8 while persecuting the minority Roma community9; and Stephen Miller designs intentionally cruel immigration policies, which a court found risked substantial harm or death to those caught up in them.10 In these, and sadly too many other cases, the fear and hatred of others, be they of a different race, religion, or ethnicity, leads directly to cruel, xenophobic policies.\nMost politicians know that being directly associated with white nationalism harms their reputation, so they use dog whistles, or euphemisms, to appeal to white nationalist supporters without alienating more moderate ones. Others have swapped their dog whistles for louder noisemakers; President Trump is perhaps the most notable example of a politician who uses this overt approach. By unpacking the core elements of white supremacist ideas, this report considers how these notions have spread into political conversation in the United States—and how some politicians have made this possible.\n#### Racist rhetoric fueling dangerous ideologies and behavior\nFrench author and far-right activist Renaud Camus coined the phrase “le grand remplacement” in a 2011 book11 to argue that Muslim immigration to France was a form of genocide against the country’s native population that required drastic action in response. This concept is not new. It echoes the ideas of early 20th-century American eugenicists Madison Grant and Lothrop Stoddard, whose work F. Scott Fitzgerald lampooned in _The Great Gatsby_.
