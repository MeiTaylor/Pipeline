(ad hoc gatherings of individuals that wear black clothing, ski masks, scarves, sunglasses, and other material to conceal their faces), use improvised explosive devices and other homemade weapons, and resort to vandalism. In addition, Antifa members organize their activities through social media, encrypted peer-to-peer networks, and encrypted messaging services such as Signal.\nAntifa groups have been increasingly active in protests and rallies over the past few years, especially ones that include far-right participants.41 In June 2016, for example, Antifa and other protestors confronted a neo-Nazi rally in Sacramento, CA, where at least five people were stabbed. In February, March, and April 2017, Antifa members attacked alt-right demonstrators at the University of California, Berkeley, using bricks, pipes, hammers, and homemade incendiary devices.42 In July 2019, William Van Spronsen,\u00a0a self-proclaimed Antifa, attempted to bomb the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Tacoma, Washington, using a propane tank but was killed by police.43\n#### **RELIGIOUS TERRORISM**\nWhile religious terrorism is concerning, the United States does not face the same level of threat today from religious extremists\u2014particularly those inspired by Salafi-jihadist groups such as the Islamic State and al-Qaeda\u2014as some European countries.44 But Salafi-jihadists still pose a limited threat. In December 2019, Second Lieutenant Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, a Saudi air force cadet training with the American military in Pensacola, Florida, killed three men and injured three others. He was inspired by al-Qaeda\u2019s ideology, communicated with leaders of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula up until the attack, and joined the Saudi military in part to carry out a \u201cspecial operation.\u201d45\nIn addition, leaders of al-Qaeda and the Islamic State continue to encourage individuals in the West\u2014including the United States\u2014to conduct attacks.46 There are still perhaps 20,000 to 25,000 jihadist fighters in Syria and Iraq from the Islamic State and another 15,000 to 20,000 fighters from two al-Qaeda-linked groups: Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham and Tanzim Hurras al-Din.47 Over the next several months, more jihadists may enter the battlefield after escaping\u2014or being released\u2014from prisons run by the Syrian Democratic Forces in areas such as al-Hol, located in eastern Syria near the border with Iraq.48 In addition, there are still concerns about al-Qaeda and Islamic State groups operating in Yemen, Nigeria and neighboring countries, Somalia, Afghanistan, and other countries.

It was early in the day, but the bass from the speakers was already thrumming, and the protesters\u2014most were young, many were not white\u2014danced behind the barricades that separated them from the Marriott where the convention was taking place. Bedecked in rainbow gear, the jubilant crowd waved signs: \u201cSTAND UP TO BULLIES,\u201d \u201cDANCE THE HATE AWAY,\u201d \u201cGO HOME, KAREN.\u201d\nThis was my second encounter with the joyful warriors, having  their convention last year, in Tampa, Florida. At that event, there were a few lackluster official protesters, but most of the action outside came from kids attending the anime gathering at the convention center next door. Back then, inside the Marriott, I watched Moms for Liberty heads Tina Descovich, Tiffany Justice, and Marie Rogerson present Gov. Ron DeSantis with a commemorative sword. The golden boy in Tampa, who would be speaking at breakfast in Philadelphia, had a far less prominent role this year; it was clear that the headliner would be Friday\u2019s evening speaker, former President Donald Trump.\n!\nDemonstrators react as James Calkins, a supporter of former President Donald Trump, walks outside the Moms for Liberty meeting in Philadelphia, Friday, June 30, 2023.\nNathan Howard/AP\nFounded in 2021, Moms for Liberty began in Florida as a protest against school closures and then mask mandates. But as the pandemic wore on, the group\u2019s mission coalesced into what is now known as the parents\u2019 rights movement, focusing on what its supporters see as the dire consequences of schools\u2019 over-involvement in shaping the moral lives of their offspring. The Moms do not think children should be learning about institutional racism in the United States. The Moms consider schools\u2019 \u2014which focus on soft skills like friendship, anger management, and being part of a community\u2014to be Trojan horses for a Marxist agenda. The Moms want to purge school libraries of books that present gender as a spectrum rather than a binary. The Moms want the federal government out of the schools, and, while they\u2019re at it, abolishing the Department of Education would be a good idea as well.\nThese positions have yielded powerful alliances with deep-pocketed conservative groups. Although as a tax-exempt \u201c\u201d its finances are not public, Moms for Liberty acknowledges that it works intensively with the right-wing Heritage Foundation and the Leadership Institute, a Republican organization devoted to training conservative leaders. These groups\u2014and others like them\u2014have likely recognized...[Content truncated]",

Since 2018, we have published this information in an annual assessment.\nIn 2023, for the second year in a row, ADL recorded its highest ever number of white supremacist propaganda incidents, with a total of 7,567 cases. This is a 12 percent increase from the 6,746 incidents in 2022.\nThere was also a 30 percent increase in specifically antisemitic propaganda, rising to 1,112 incidents in 2023 from 852 incidents in 2022. This increase was largely due to the white supremacist group Patriot Front reincorporating antisemitic phrases into their propaganda. It was also buoyed by anti-Zionist and anti-Israel sentiment following the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.\nAnti-LGBTQ+ propaganda by white supremacists saw a massive 141 percent jump, increasing from 68 incidents in 2022 to 164 in 2023.\nThere were 282 documented white supremacist events in 2023, a 63 percent increase from the 173 recorded in 2022.\nThis annual assessment is just one dataset that helps to quantify the hate marginalized communities, especially those who are Jewish, LGBTQ+, Black...[Content truncated]",
