It has also caused great pain to Canada's Jewish community, Holocaust survivors, veterans and other victims of the Nazi regime.\"\nIn an earlier apology on Sunday, Rota said he alone was responsible for inviting and recognizing Hunka, who is from the district that Rota represents. The speaker's office said it was Hunka's son who contacted Rota's local office to see if it was possible if he could attend Zelenskyy's speech.\nThe prime minister's office said it was unaware that Hunka was invited until after the address. The speaker's office also confirmed it did not share its invite list with any other party or group. The vetting process for visitors to the gallery is for physical security threats, not reputational threats, the speaker's office said.\nIn Moscow, a Kremlin spokesman said it was \"outrageous\" that Hunka received a standing ovation.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has painted his enemies in Ukraine as \"neo-Nazis,\" although Zelenskyy is Jewish and lost relatives in the Holocaust.\n\"It's highly unfortunate and the only winner here is the Putin regime, which is already spinning what happened on Friday to justify its ongoing military actions in Ukraine,\" said Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal,\nThe opposition Conservatives in Canada have blamed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, but B\u00e9land noted that the speaker's role in Canada is as an officer of Parliament who does not participate in partisan caucus meetings and is not a member of the Cabinet.\n\"Canada's reputation is broken. This is by far the biggest hit Canada's diplomatic reputation has ever taken under in history and it happened under Justin Trudeau's watch,\" Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said.\nPoilievre said everyone in the House of Commons on Friday should have been vetted with Zelenskyy in attendance.\nRobert Bothwell, a historian and professor at the University of Toronto, called Rota clueless for...[Content truncated]",

Anna V. Eskamani said it was filmed in Cranes Roost Park in the center of the town. Another series of clips uploaded to X by journalist Oliya Scootercaster shows men dressed in red and black giving Nazi salutes on an overpass, although it was not clear if the groups were connected.\n!\nChristopher \"Hammer\" Pohlhaus (center) leads a rally of neo-Nazi groups September 2, 2023, in Orlando, Florida. An event labeled the \"Red Shirts March\" attracted about 100 people at the weekend. Christopher \"Hammer\" Pohlhaus (center) leads a rally of neo-Nazi groups September 2, 2023, in Orlando, Florida. An event labeled the \"Red Shirts March\" attracted about 100 people at the weekend. Getty\nThe footage also contained several instances of racist speech and harassment toward Jewish people and anti-racists.\nIn videos uploaded to X, white supremacist and Goyim Defense League (GDL) founder Jon Minadeo II and the leader of neo-Nazi group Blood Tribe, Christopher Pohlhaus, were present. Among the racist stunts carried out by the pair in the past is a recording of  at the gates of the former Nazi death camp Auschwitz last year.\n> Nazis in Altamonte Springs at Cranes Roost Park screaming \u201cwe are every where\u201d \u2014 absolutely disgusting stuff and another example of the far right extremism growing in FL. \n> \n> \u2014 Rep. Anna V. Eskamani \ud83d\udd28 (@AnnaForFlorida) \nIn the footage, some members of the group said they supported President  over his support for Ukraine and, by extension, the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion, while another group was heard saying he supported Florida Gov. , although he backtracked on the statement later.\nNeo-Nazis and other white supremacist groups have a history of trolling and paradoxically endorsing causes they do not agree with, including politics.
