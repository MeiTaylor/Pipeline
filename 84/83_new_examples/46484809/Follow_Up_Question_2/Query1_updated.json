Rogers, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, for driving a vehicle into peaceful protesters. Around the same time, members of a Brooklyn anarchist group urged its supporters to conduct \u201crebellion\u201d against the government.2 Extremists from all sides flooded social media with disinformation, conspiracy theories, and incitements to violence in response to the protests following the death of George Floyd, swamping Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and other platforms.3\nThis CSIS brief examines the state of terrorism in the United States.

I was born and raised in the area; I raised my children here. As a result, I believe that service to you, my friends and neighbors, is the most important part of my job.\nIn addition to good constituent services, there are a number of issues that are near and dear to me. Things like mental health coverage, workers\u2019 rights, quality education, economic development and improved access to health care are issues that I have fought for during my time in the Legislature. These are issues that impact all of us. In order to do my job, I rely on your input on legislative matters, so when you have thoughts or concerns about where the state is headed, share them with me. I want to know what you think.\nThank you for visiting my website and for allowing me to serve as your State Senator. I look forward to hearing from...[Content truncated]",

Reasonable estimates on the numbers of Skinheads in each country were obtained by tallying Skinhead numbers at rallies, marches, concerts, festivals, soccer matches, and other gatherings. The Skinhead movement is active in 33 countries on six continents. It numbers some 70,000 youths worldwide, of whom half are hardcore activists and the rest supporters. The countries where Skinheads are found in the greatest numbers are Germany (5,000), Hungary and the Czech Republic (more than 4,000 each), the United States (3,500), Poland (2,000), the United Kingdom and Brazil (1,500 each), Italy (1,000 to 1,500), and Sweden (more than 1,000). France, Spain, Canada, and the Netherlands each have at least 500 Skinheads. The Skinhead movements in these various countries are extensively linked with each other. This \"Skinhead International\" is maintained through the travels abroad of popular Skinhead rock bands and their fans; the worldwide marketing of Skinhead paraphernalia and recordings; the sale and trading of publications; the exchange of propaganda; and the use of electronic communications.
