Novitsky, a former fighter pilot selected as a cosmonaut in 2006, has flown three missions aboard Soyuz to the ISS and has spent 531 days, six hours, and 58 minutes in space to date.\nNovitsky’s first mission was Soyuz TMA-06M, which launched in October 2012. He served over five months on the Station as an ISS flight engineer on Expeditions 33 and 34 and launched on his second flight aboard Soyuz MS-03 in November 2016. This time, Novitsky spent 196 days, or six and a half months, in space as part of Expeditions 50 and 51. His third spaceflight launched in April 2021, when he flew aboard Soyuz MS-18 and served with Expeditions 64 and 65, landing in October 2021. Novitsky has also performed three spacewalks while aboard the ISS.\n]At an orbital sunrise, Oleg Novitsky and Pyotr Dubrov work on the Strela crane outside the Poisk module during Novitsky’s most recent stay aboard ISS. (Credit: NASA/Roscosmos)\nMS-25 spaceflight participant Marina Vasilevskaya, 33, graduated from a secondary school in Minsk, Belarus, and became a flight attendant for Belavia. As a flight attendant, Vasilevskaya worked aboard Boeing and Embraer jetliners, and she participated in a national competitive selection held by the Belarusian Academy of Sciences for the “Belarusian Woman in Space” project.\nVasilevskaya was one of six applicants chosen in December 2022. By May 2023, she was one of two remaining finalists and was chosen as a prime crew member for the ISS EP-21 expedition, which is a designation for a visiting flight that temporarily visits the Station. The first paying space tourist, Dennis Tito, flew aboard the first visiting expedition in the spring of 2001. Vasilevskaya is the only rookie aboard this flight, making her first flight to space.\nThe third crewmember aboard Soyuz MS-25 is veteran NASA astronaut Tracy Caldwell Dyson. Dyson, 54, was born in Arcadia, California, and holds a bachelor’s degree from California State University in Fullerton, along with a master’s degree and a doctorate from the University of California in Davis. She is a chemist who has had numerous scientific papers published and also has experience as an electrician and a private pilot.\n]Tracy Caldwell’s astronaut portrait in 1998.

About 25 percent of all full moons are supermoons, but only 3 percent of full moons are blue moons. The time between super blue moons is quite irregular ― it can be as much as 20 years ― but in general, 10 years is the average.

Novitsky, a former fighter pilot selected as a cosmonaut in 2006, has flown three missions aboard Soyuz to the ISS and has spent 531 days, six hours, and 58 minutes in space to date.\nNovitsky’s first mission was Soyuz TMA-06M, which launched in October 2012. He served over five months on the Station as an ISS flight engineer on Expeditions 33 and 34 and launched on his second flight aboard Soyuz MS-03 in November 2016. This time, Novitsky spent 196 days, or six and a half months, in space as part of Expeditions 50 and 51. His third spaceflight launched in April 2021, when he flew aboard Soyuz MS-18 and served with Expeditions 64 and 65, landing in October 2021. Novitsky has also performed three spacewalks while aboard the ISS.\n]At an orbital sunrise, Oleg Novitsky and Pyotr Dubrov work on the Strela crane outside the Poisk module during Novitsky’s most recent stay aboard ISS. (Credit: NASA/Roscosmos)\nMS-25 spaceflight participant Marina Vasilevskaya, 33, graduated from a secondary school in Minsk, Belarus, and became a flight attendant for Belavia. As a flight attendant, Vasilevskaya worked aboard Boeing and Embraer jetliners, and she participated in a national competitive selection held by the Belarusian Academy of Sciences for the “Belarusian Woman in Space” project.\nVasilevskaya was one of six applicants chosen in December 2022. By May 2023, she was one of two remaining finalists and was chosen as a prime crew member for the ISS EP-21 expedition, which is a designation for a visiting flight that temporarily visits the Station. The first paying space tourist, Dennis Tito, flew aboard the first visiting expedition in the spring of 2001. Vasilevskaya is the only rookie aboard this flight, making her first flight to space.\nThe third crewmember aboard Soyuz MS-25 is veteran NASA astronaut Tracy Caldwell Dyson. Dyson, 54, was born in Arcadia, California, and holds a bachelor’s degree from California State University in Fullerton, along with a master’s degree and a doctorate from the University of California in Davis. She is a chemist who has had numerous scientific papers published and also has experience as an electrician and a private pilot.\n]Tracy Caldwell’s astronaut portrait in 1998.

        "Question": "What independent verification exists to confirm the video's date and location in Kazakhstan?",
        "Answer": "The independent verification that confirms the video's date and location in Kazakhstan, particularly at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, can be drawn from several sources:\n\n1. **Video Title and Context**: The video is explicitly titled \"Baikonur Cosmodrome - Southern Kazakhstan 06/10/2022\". This title serves as direct evidence that the footage was captured in or around the Baikonur Cosmodrome, which is located in Kazakhstan. The date mentioned correlates with the timeline suggested by the video itself, thus establishing a context for the reasons behind its filming.\n\n2. **Confirmation from Space Missions**: The Baikonur Cosmodrome is recognized as the primary launch site for both piloted and unpiloted spacecraft, as noted in various spaceflight documentation. For example, a reference guide discusses the significance of the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan as a launch center, indicating that any media associated with space missions from this site is linked to this location.\n\n3. **Recent Launch Events**: News articles referencing launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome reinforce the validity of the location. For instance, a report on a Soyuz MS-24 launch highlights that the spacecraft launched successfully from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, corroborating the location's use in recent space operations.\n\nBased on the combined strength of these references, I would estimate a confidence level of **85%**. This confidence reflects the logical connections drawn from the available evidence, although an absolute confirmation remains difficult without further direct visual evidence from the video itself to independently verify the specific date and event in question.",
