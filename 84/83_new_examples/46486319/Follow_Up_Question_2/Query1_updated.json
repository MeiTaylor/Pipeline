Novitsky, a former fighter pilot selected as a cosmonaut in 2006, has flown three missions aboard Soyuz to the ISS and has spent 531 days, six hours, and 58 minutes in space to date.\nNovitsky\u2019s first mission was Soyuz TMA-06M, which launched in October 2012. He served over five months on the Station as an ISS flight engineer on Expeditions 33 and 34 and launched on his second flight aboard Soyuz MS-03 in November 2016. This time, Novitsky spent 196 days, or six and a half months, in space as part of Expeditions 50 and 51. His third spaceflight launched in April 2021, when he flew aboard Soyuz MS-18 and served with Expeditions 64 and 65, landing in October 2021. Novitsky has also performed three spacewalks while aboard the ISS.\n]At an orbital sunrise, Oleg Novitsky and Pyotr Dubrov work on the Strela crane outside the Poisk module during Novitsky\u2019s most recent stay aboard ISS. (Credit: NASA/Roscosmos)\nMS-25 spaceflight participant Marina Vasilevskaya, 33, graduated from a secondary school in Minsk, Belarus, and became a flight attendant for Belavia. As a flight attendant, Vasilevskaya worked aboard Boeing and Embraer jetliners, and she participated in a national competitive selection held by the Belarusian Academy of Sciences for the \u201cBelarusian Woman in Space\u201d project.\nVasilevskaya was one of six applicants chosen in December 2022. By May 2023, she was one of two remaining finalists and was chosen as a prime crew member for the ISS EP-21 expedition, which is a designation for a visiting flight that temporarily visits the Station. The first paying space tourist, Dennis Tito, flew aboard the first visiting expedition in the spring of 2001. Vasilevskaya is the only rookie aboard this flight, making her first flight to space.\nThe third crewmember aboard Soyuz MS-25 is veteran NASA astronaut Tracy Caldwell Dyson. Dyson, 54, was born in Arcadia, California, and holds a bachelor\u2019s degree from California State University in Fullerton, along with a master\u2019s degree and a doctorate from the University of California in Davis. She is a chemist who has had numerous scientific papers published and also has experience as an electrician and a private pilot.\n]Tracy Caldwell\u2019s astronaut portrait in 1998.
