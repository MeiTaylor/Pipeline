You can follow the Station\u2019s location using the map at the top right-hand-side of the screen alongside annotations on the photos themselves. As the map is a two-dimensional representation of Earth\u2019s globe the ground track of the Space Station appears to be wavy.\n    This timelapse comprises approximately 21 375 images of Earth captured by Alexander from the International Space Station orbiting at 400 km altitude and shown 12.5 times faster than actual speed. The images were taken from the European-built Cupola observatory on 6 October 2018.\n    At 28 800 km/h it only takes 90 minutes for the weightless laboratory to make a complete circuit of Earth so the video shows the world passing from day to night and back again twice. The darker regions on the map shows where night is on Earth.\n    As the Space Station flies into the night the solar wings rotate to get ready to capture...[Content truncated]",

Yet, for decades to come the Soviet government would not confirm the exact location of the test range.\nVIRTUAL GUIDE TO BAIKONUR COSMODROME\n]****\nBaikonur Cosmodrome, aka TyNIIP-5 test range, is traditionally subdivided into three regions, which used to be dominated by the launch and processing facilities of the major players in the Soviet rocketry -- Sergei Korolev, Mikhail Yangel and Vladimir Chelomei. These regions are known as \"center,\" \"right flank\" and \"left flank.\"\n]\n****\nA virtual tour along the historic road, connecting the town of Baikonur, formerly known as Leninsk, with the launch facilities deep in the steppe. The infamous \"motovoz\" -- a diesel-powered train shuttling between the town and launch complexes -- has been perhaps the most enduring icon of Baikonur, immortalized in a popular folk song about the center.\n]\n****\nThe very first launch complex founded in 1955 in Tyuratam included a single launch pad at Site 1 and the assembly and processing buildings at Site 2 and 2B. The original R-7 rocket blasted off from Site 1 in May 1957. The world's first artificial satellite was launched from the same pad on October 4, 1957. Following the launch of Vostok-1 in 1961, the Site 1 was nicknamed Gagarin's pad. The complex has remained operational at the turn of the 21st century, after hosting around 400 launches. The second launch pad for R-7-based rockets has been operating at Site 31 since 1960.\n!\n**Launch facilities for R-16 ICBM and Kosmos-1 launcher**\nAround November 1959, the construction of the first launch pads for the  missile started at Site 41. The facility included two surface pads designated PU-3 (Puskovaya Ustanovka) and PU-4. The concrete works started here on December 5, 1959, and according to the construction schedule signed on December 17, 1959, the pads were expected to be ready by September 1960.
