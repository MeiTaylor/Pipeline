That\u2019s the theory he admits he started with, even before he got to the area. But other space experts have pointed out that the region is a drop zone for discarded rocket stages launched into space from Russia\u2019s Baikonur base, and in fact was the crash site of one prototype manned space capsule at the very dawn of the space age.\nOn June 30, 1908, residents of southern Siberia spotted a dazzling fireball crossing the sky, followed by a flare brighter than the sun. Minutes later, a shock wave knocked many of those residents off their feet. When later expeditions reached the nearly inaccessible swamps where the explosion had occurred, they found trees flattened down in a pattern pointing away from ground zero \u2014 but no crater, and no meteorite fragments.\nThe first Soviet expedition was sent to the site in 1927, in hopes of finding metallic ore. Although a series of natural theories followed over the years, a Russian scientist and science-fiction author...[Content truncated]",

CSO-2 satellite payload on Arianespace\u2019s Flight VS25.\nArianespace\u2019s workhorse Soyuz was back in action today, delivering the French CSO-2 Earth observation satellite into Sun-synchronous orbit from the Spaceport.\nThis afternoon\u2019s launch, which began at the exact liftoff time of 1:42:07 p.m. in French Guiana, deployed the spacecraft passenger during a mission lasting just under one hour.\nIt was Arianespace\u2019s 10th and final flight of 2020 \u2013 and the fifth this year using the medium-lift vehicle \u2013 coming just 11 days after another Soyuz was launched by the company and its Starsem affiliate from Russia\u2019s Vostochny Cosmodrome to deliver 36 satellites for the OneWeb constellation.\n**Soyuz brings exceptional flexibility to Arianespace**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n!During 2020, Arianespace conducted Soyuz missions from three different launch sites, including the Spaceport in French Guiana, where Flight VS25 was performed today to orbit France\u2019s CSO-2 satellite.\nThe 2020 operations with Soyuz underscored the medium-lift launcher\u2019s exceptional flexibility for Arianespace\u2019s launch services offering, having been utilized during the year from three different facilities: the Guiana Space Center in South America; Kazakhstan\u2019s Baikonur Cosmodrome; and Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia.\nToday\u2019s mission, designated Flight VS25 in Arianespace\u2019s launcher family numbering system, utilized a Soyuz ST-A version and was performed for the French CNES space agency and the DGA defense procurement agency. The CSO-2 satellite will be operated on behalf of the French armed forces and the country\u2019s Space Command.\nCSO-2 serves the defense and security needs of France, as well as the requirements of several partner countries, acquiring very-high-resolution images in the visible and infrared wavelengths \u2013 day or night and in fair weather \u2013 using a variety of imaging modes to meet a broad range of operational needs.\n**Arianespace\u2019s second launch for the French CSO program**\n----------------------------------------------------------\nFrance\u2019s Optical Space Component (CSO \u2013 Composante Spatiale Optique) program is composed of three satellites serving two mission requirements: reconnaissance for CSO-1 and CSO-3; identification for CSO-2. The initial satellite in this system, CSO-1, was orbited by Arianespace on a Soyuz mission in December 2018 that also was performed from the Spaceport in French Guiana.\nAirbus Defence and Space France is prime contractor for the CSO satellites, while Thales Alenia Space France supplies the optical imaging...[Content truncated]",
