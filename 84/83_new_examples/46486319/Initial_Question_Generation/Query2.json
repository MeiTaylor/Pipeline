Ahead of a Congressional hearing on UFOs this week, one in ten Americans report that they have seen an unidentified flying object (UFO), unchanged over time. Four times as many Americans (42%) believe in UFOs. When it comes to other unexplainable phenomena, about three in ten (28%) report that, at some point, they have woken up from sleep with a sense of a strange presence in the room, and one in four (25%) have seen or believed themselves to have been in the presence of a ghost. Beyond that experience, two in five (39%) believe in ghosts.\nSeparately, 15% of Americans report using an AI chat or text program in the past month, down 5 points from April 2023.\n### **About the Study**\nThis...[Content truncated]",

(2024). The cryptoterrestrial hypothesis: A case for \nscientific openness to a subterranean earthly explanation for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena . Philosophy \nand Cosmology . Volume 33 . https://doi.org/ \nRecent years have seen increasing public attention and indeed concern regarding Unidentified \nAnomalous Phenomena (UAP). Hypotheses for such phenomena tend to fall into two classes: a \nconventional terrestrial explanation (e.g., human -made technology), or an extraterrestrial explanation \n(i.e., advanced civilizations from elsewhere in the cosmos). However, there is also a third minority \nclass of hypothesis: an unconven tional terrestrial explanation, outside the prevailing consensus view of \nthe universe. This is the ultraterrestrial hypothesis, which includes as a subset the “cryptoterrestrial” \nhypothesis, namely the notion that UAP may reflect activities of intelligent beings concealed in stealth \nhere on...[Content truncated]",

A remote farmer in  reported a saucer-shaped object near a swamp in one sighting. About six months later, some students in  reported a UFO sighting over their school. Although as a country Australia has minimal interest in spotting UFO sightings, the country still has 44% of the population believing in alien civilizations.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nEvery year there are several UFO sightings in France, and in general, the population has a vested interest in spotting UFOs. One of the most famous UFO sightings occurred on October 21, 1982, in Nancy, France. Shortly after midnight, an object dropped into a garden before hovering over the ground. The object stayed suspended in the air for about 20 minutes before the object flew off. The witness was a scientist who observed the grass standing straight up when the UFO hovered and eventually flew away. In the afternoon, the areas under the UFO appeared withered. Scientific analysis of the plants discovered they were dehydrated, but there was no radiation detected.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlthough there have been several UFO sightings in Argentina, much of the validity and interest in UFOs and alien life is hard to judge. Some suspect that the interest is simply because Argentinians see other major countries worldwide with UFOs and merely want to be a part of the recent trend. Still, to celebrate possible extraterrestrial life, Argentina even hosts a UFO festival to honor the most famous UFO sighting from 1986, which took place in Capilla del Monte.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlthough most people might think the  sees the bulk of UFO activity, Canada has been known for some pretty remarkable UFO sightings. One of the most famous sightings occurred in Manitoba on May 19. 1967. Two UFOs were reported near Falcon Lake, where witness Stefan Michalak reported sustained burn injuries from close contact. The UFO sighting went on to spur two different books detailing the encounter. Although there have been vocal skeptics about the encounter, in April 2018, Canada released a $20 coin commemorating the strange events.\nThe United States\n-----------------\nBetween 1947 and 1969, the United States reported more than 12,000 different UFO sightings around the country. There are several eyewitness accounts, but many of the sightings seem to be centered around the activity of Roswell, . The town itself has transformed into a UFO and extraterrestrial , bringing people from around the world to catch a glimpse of the unusual activity, hopefully.

It was a tale of _“crazy explorers”_ (what I thought of them back then, actually that opinion hasn’t changed 😉 ) who hiked across the desert and infiltrated Russian military base. To this day I remember my astonishment and disbelieve that two abandoned space shuttles can be left somewhere unattended. Just sitting there in a huge hangar somewhere is the middle of Kazakhstan. How incredible!? My life continued with some ups and downs and along the way I discovered __, moved to China and abandoned my previous way of living. Did you see what I did there? 😉\n!\n**At some stage in 2018** I convinced myself that I want to do this. The process of research begun. Firstly, I had no idea where the exact location of the hangars is and secondly, how to get there. Step by step, with time I managed to acquire all the necessary information and begun my training. After talking to several Russian explorers, I made few crucial points:\n**1)** I will not be driving inside the desert – too risky getting your car seen;\n**2)** I need to time my arrival to get inside the hangar in the middle of the night and only move to the rocket building also at night (following day) – there are two locations: the shuttles and the rocket;\n**3)** I had to prepare myself physically for the long hike in the desert. I was told: _“It’s not the walk that kills you, it’s the heavy bag with all your equipment and water”_, hence, I needed to...[Content truncated]",
