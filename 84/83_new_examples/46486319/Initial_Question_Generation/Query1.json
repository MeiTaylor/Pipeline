While writing  I came across a number of reports of strange aerial phenomena in the area around the plant itself, as well as over the nearby Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Then I started digging deeper – looking at the historical connection between UFO sightings, and places associated with nuclear research and power. Eventually this led me to Canada, where I realised that a famous 1967 UFO sighting – the ‘Falcon Lake Incident’ – might actually share a surprising and uncanny connection with the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in Ukraine.\nOriginally I planned to mention these Chernobyl UFOs in the book. But the story quickly grew from a few interesting reports – a passing curiosity – into a whole chapter of its own. And this new UFO chapter, jumping about from Chernobyl to North Wales, to Roswell and Winnipeg (and filled throughout with unreliable words like “allegedly,” and “claimed,” and “believed”), increasingly felt like it didn’t belong in this book… which was otherwise evolving into quite a tight, keenly-focussed and evidence-driven volume.\nSo instead, I decided I would share this ‘missing chapter’ here: a deep dive into the subject of Chernobyl UFO...[Content truncated]",

This is what he told me.\nAt between 1.00 and 1.30 on March 6, 1996 he woke up and because he knew it would be quiet at that hour, he decided to do some studying for his exams. Whilst thus engaged, he heard a clicking sound, not unlike a telephone dialling except there are no telephones in this area. It continued for some minutes, so Lloyd decided to check what it could be. He opened the front door and looked outside. He could hear the sound coming from up the road and when he glanced in that direction, he witnessed something very strange. He quickly went outside and hid behind a hedge to get a better view. He was able to observe a small figure, about 1 metre high, with a head like a rugby-ball, dressed all in white overalls. On its back the creature had a small satchel, attached to which was an aerial with a flashing red light. Lloyd was terrified. He told me he was \"asphyxiated with fear\", and ran back into the house, jumped into bed and covered himself with his blankets. He slept fitfully for the rest of the night.\nAt 6.00 the next morning he went to look where the creature had walked and found several footprints which he could not identify and which he attributed to the creature. When he arrived at school he told his friends about seeing a ghost in the night, but one of his friends suggested that it was a UFO. Lloyd is now under the impression that the creature is called a UFO.\nOpposite Lloyd's house is a teaching centre guarded at night by a security firm. My enquiries led me to one of their guards, a woman named Kumbadzai, who had been on duty at the centre when she saw what she called a ghost. She was so disturbed by this event that she had found herself another job elsewhere. Kumbadzai told me that she had heard clicking sounds and been frightened, had hidden behind a wall and seen a figure in white. It passed her twice, and the second time the figure had been covered in \"rainbow colours\".\n* * *\n### 01.03\n#### Zimbabwe \\\nMy name is Johan Reitman and I farm near Feathersdorp, 150 km from Harare.

Many satellites in low Earth orbit appear as fast-moving points of light in the night sky. Satellites reflect sunlight and can sometimes be visible to the naked eye, especially on clear nights. The motion you described, heading north, is consistent with the typical orbital path of a satellite as it passes overhead. Other possible explanations could include a high-altitude aircraft or a meteor, but the steady, linear motion you witnessed suggests a satellite is the most plausible explanation.\nUpvote ·\n]\nRelated\nTonight I saw star like object moving quite fast across night sky & later it disappeared.

That’s the theory he admits he started with, even before he got to the area. But other space experts have pointed out that the region is a drop zone for discarded rocket stages launched into space from Russia’s Baikonur base, and in fact was the crash site of one prototype manned space capsule at the very dawn of the space age.\nOn June 30, 1908, residents of southern Siberia spotted a dazzling fireball crossing the sky, followed by a flare brighter than the sun. Minutes later, a shock wave knocked many of those residents off their feet. When later expeditions reached the nearly inaccessible swamps where the explosion had occurred, they found trees flattened down in a pattern pointing away from ground zero — but no crater, and no meteorite fragments.\nThe first Soviet expedition was sent to the site in 1927, in hopes of finding metallic ore. Although a series of natural theories followed over the years, a Russian scientist and science-fiction author...[Content truncated]",

With Bill typing what she had taken down every day, A Course in Miracles \ncame into being. I asked Helen, the first day I met her, \"Did the voice have a name? Did it identify itself, such as the Seth material and others?\" She said, \"I was afraid you were going to ask that,\" and Bill Thetford said, \"Why don't you tell her, dear? She is going to read it.\" And she said, \"It says it is Jesus.\" I said, \"Well, is it?\" And she said, \"Of course,\" which was interesting, because on the one hand, as a Jewish lady, she did not believe in it, but on a metaphorical level she knew it was true. I think we are all in that position in our lives. There is something that we know is true, but we do not agree to believe in it. I could not have predicted, in 1975, that there would be three hundred thousand copies of A Course in Miracles in circulation. I have no idea how many people study one copy, so I am guessing over a half a million folk are students of A Course in Miracles . I think we are probably laying the foundation, along with many others, who share basically the same point of view but go about it in different ways -- a foundation for a tremendous change of mind, which I call the great transformation. 153 \nThe Invisible College \nEarlier we discussed the image of the Invisible College used by the early Rosicrucians to symbolize their internal contact with higher intelligence. (This same term has been used by scientists, such as Jacques Vallee and J. Allen Hynek, to refer to the loosely connected network of scientists investigating the UFO data.) An interesting perspective on the Invisible College comes from a report from Dr. Shafica Karagula, director of the Higher Sense Perception Research Foundation in Los Angeles. Karagula specialized in clinical studies of individuals who are gifted with unusual perceptive talents. One of her subjects, whom she called Vicky described a series of experiences she had in her sleep where she seemed to be visiting a college and attending classes in many different subjects. Her vision was quite lucid, recalling the architecture of the buildings, and the subject matter of her lectures. The lectures follow an orderly sequence and Karagula claimed to have carefully recorded a number of them from Vicky. On one occasion, Vicky remembered that a friend of hers,...[Content truncated]",
