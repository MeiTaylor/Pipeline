TRANS BLACK LIVES MATTER.\u201d\nThat tells us a bit about where we are today, and how we got here.\nThe point I was making in the early 1990s was that liberalism knows limits. A liberal politics does not seek to impose meaning on everyone; it creates the space for individuals to choose that for themselves. It doesn\u2019t seek to deliver the truth about anything either; it merely provides the mechanisms for the open-ended _pursuit_ of truth. A liberal politics will seek formal equality for members of minorities; but not _substantive_ equality \u2014 what is now called \u201cequity.\u201d It would not require us to come to one, single understanding of reality; it would always allow diversity of opinion and encourage free debate. Live and let live. Remember that?\nTechnically speaking, that makes me a liberal conservative: accepting the reality of liberal modernity (even, in my own case, being happily at home in it), while seeking to limit its illiberal overreach and utopian ambitions. And that was what I tried to sketch out in __. It\u2019s a book less about homosexuality than about politics itself. It\u2019s about a politics of going this far \u2014 and no farther. From the  in 1995:\n> Mr. Sullivan offers his own prescription for a \u201cpolitics of homosexuality\u201d that reconciles \u201cthe best arguments of liberals and conservatives.\u201d It is a liberal stand, Mr. Sullivan argues, in that it puts a premium on individual liberty and equality before the law, but its requirements would apply only to government policies on homosexuality, avoiding \u201cthe regulation of people\u2019s minds and actions\u201d in the private sphere.\nHomosexual citizens absolutely deserved equal rights, but the question of homosexuality itself would \u2014 and _should_ \u2014 always be open to dispute and debate. Since a liberal society contains both fundamentalist preachers as well as lesbian atheists, it cannot resolve the core question. So it shouldn\u2019t try. And it should celebrate, not bemoan, this ideological diversity.\nI can see why the religious fundamentalists are queasy with the settlement that came from this. They have to live in a society that accepts civil marriages for couples of the same sex. The deal is that in return, they are free to deny the morality of such marriages, to reserve religious marriage to heterosexual couples, and not be forced to participate in any way. I can also see why queer theorists are queasy as well. They don\u2019t like the heteronormativity of civil marriage, or the respectability politics...[Content truncated]",
