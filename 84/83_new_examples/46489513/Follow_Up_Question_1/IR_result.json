        "Question": "What were the main reasons Elton John provided for not pursuing U.S. concert residencies?",
        "Answer": "Elton John provided a few main reasons for not pursuing concert residencies in the U.S. Firstly, he expressed his strong discontent with the current climate regarding LGBTQ+ rights, describing it as a \"growing swell of anger and homophobia\" that he believes is prevalent in America. He criticized recent anti-LGBTQ+ laws enacted in states like Florida, calling them \"disgraceful\" and stating that such legislation indicates a societal regression in terms of rights and acceptance for the LGBTQ+ community. Secondly, Elton John indicated a personal decision to step back from his career to spend more quality time with his family. He mentioned that he was ready to focus on his \"real family\" instead of his \"work family,\" implying that personal priorities play a significant role in his decision to not pursue additional U.S. performances. In summary, the reasons Elton John provided for not pursuing U.S. concert residencies revolve around his objection to the prevailing anti-LGBTQ+ legislative environment and his desire to prioritize family time, indicating a combination of sociopolitical concerns and personal motives.",
