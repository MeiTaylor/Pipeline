If it was a straight guy in a fling with a young woman, it wouldn’t even make the papers.”\nThe 76-year-old, who is headlining Glastonbury’s Pyramid stage next Sunday, decided to embark on his final tour – Farewell Yellow Brick Road – seven years ago in order to spend more time with his sons. A desire to spend more time with his family has led to the singer saying he would no longer do residencies in the US, though he would consider more live shows elsewhere.\nThough the tour was originally envisaged as lasting for three years, the pandemic – and a hip replacement – wrecked those plans, and by the time it finally ends in Stockholm on 8 July, it will have lasted for almost five years and encompassed 333 shows.\nBut despite the extensive victory lap, John said he wasn’t completely done with performing live. “I said when I announced the farewell tour that maybe I would do a residency like Kate Bush did at Hammersmith \\, but not in America. I will not do it in America,” he said.\nJohn has sold about 300m records in a career spanning more than half a century, and is the highest-grossing solo artist of all time, with his earnings totalling $1.898bn, according to Billboard magazine.\nIn recent years, he has found chart success through collaborations with contemporary hitmakers such as Britney Spears and Dua Lipa, which he called “an incredible boost” in his later career.\nThe veteran musician, who became a larger-than-life public figure in the 1970s and developed a reputation for excess – immortalised in the 1997 documentary Tantrums & Tiaras, by his husband, David Furnish – is now performing at Glastonbury for the first time.\n“It’s the only really important festival for me in the world, to be honest. It’s all about music,”...[Content truncated]"

    "QA": {
        "Question": "Did Elton John explicitly state he would cease performing in the U.S. due to anti-LGBTQ+ legislation?",
        "Answer": "Elton John did not explicitly state that he would cease performing in the U.S. solely due to anti-LGBTQ+ legislation; rather, his comments suggest a combination of personal choices and concerns over the current social climate. He mentioned that he would not pursue concert residencies in the U.S. and expressed his discontent with the worsening state of LGBTQ+ rights there. During an interview, he clarified, “I said when I announced the farewell tour that maybe I would do a residency... but not in America. I will not do it in America.” His remarks about the situation include strong criticisms of newly enacted laws in states like Florida, describing them as “disgraceful,” and he expressed that the U.S. is experiencing a “growing swell of anger and homophobia.” While he is stepping back from certain U.S. performances, the decision appears to be influenced by his desire to spend more time with his family combined with a response to the prevailing sociopolitical environment, rather than an outright ban on performing there due to specific laws. In summary, Elton John’s hesitation to perform in the U.S. pertains to both personal priorities and his reactions to the anti-LGBTQ+ climate, but he did not draw a direct linkage between his decision and a complete refusal to perform based on legislation.",
