It’s like a virus that the LGBTQ+ movement is suffering.”\nJohn, who founded the Elton John Aids Foundation, which has raised more than $525m and by its own estimation saved 5 million lives, expressed his deep unhappiness about the growing tide of homophobia, which he said extended to Britain.\n“I don’t like it at all,” he said. “It’s a growing swell of anger and homophobia that’s around America. I don’t know if it’s around Britain, because I haven’t been here that much.\n“But I feel that the Phillip Schofield thing has been totally homophobic. If it was a straight guy in a fling with a young woman, it wouldn’t even make the papers.”\nThe 76-year-old, who is headlining Glastonbury’s Pyramid stage next Sunday, decided to embark on his final tour – Farewell Yellow Brick Road – seven years ago in order to spend more time with his sons. A desire to spend more time with his family has led to the singer saying he would no longer do residencies in the US, though he would consider more live shows elsewhere.\nThough the tour was originally envisaged as lasting for three years, the pandemic – and a hip replacement – wrecked those plans, and by the time it finally ends in Stockholm on 8 July, it will have lasted for almost five years and encompassed 333 shows.\nBut despite the extensive victory lap, John said he wasn’t completely done with performing live. “I said when I announced the farewell tour that maybe I would do a residency like Kate Bush did at Hammersmith \\, but not in America. I will not do it in America,” he said.\nJohn has sold about 300m records in a career spanning more than half a century, and is the highest-grossing solo artist of all time, with his earnings totalling $1.898bn, according to Billboard magazine.\nIn recent years, he has found chart success through collaborations with contemporary hitmakers such as Britney Spears and Dua Lipa, which he called “an incredible boost” in his later career.\nThe veteran musician, who became a larger-than-life public figure in the 1970s and developed a reputation for excess – immortalised in the 1997 documentary Tantrums & Tiaras, by his husband, David Furnish – is now performing at Glastonbury for the first time.\n“It’s the only really important festival for me in the world, to be honest. It’s all about music,”...[Content truncated]",

As I arrived at Schiphol airport, donning a \"Silence=Death\" t-shirt in homage to ACT UP and ready to experience all that the conference and Amsterdam had to offer, I never would have imagined that on just the second day of the conference I would bear witness to the silencing of black gay men's voices and an affront to the experiences of black people across the diaspora -- perpetrated by none other than Elton John and his foundation.\nWith the honor of attending such an important meeting comes not only accountability to the communities from which we hail as conference delegates, but also a responsibility to ensure that individuals speaking to our communities' issues do so respectfully and with the cultural humility it behooves any of us to model whenever occupying a critical world stage. Thus, I would be remiss not to shine a light on Elton John's problematic remarks during a session focused on combating worldwide HIV- and LGBTQIA-related stigma, in which he patronizingly admonished black people for not loving each other enough, and in which he called out black American celebrities for allegedly not doing enough to fight stigma globally among black communities.\nA Focus on Key Populations\n--------------------------\nThe session was organized by the Elton John AIDS Foundation (EJAF) and was intended, or so it initially seemed, to highlight the perilous circumstances that black people in Africa live under due to HIV- and LGBTQIA-related stigma. As we saw in a series of powerful photographs from , and as we learned from numerous art exhibits and educational booths at the AIDS 2018 Global Village, for many LGBTQIA African people and other socially marginalized groups across...[Content truncated]",

That would set Mum off. I got the feeling they were staying together because of me, which just made things more miserable. The best way to escape it was to shut myself in my bedroom with my record collection and my comics, and drift off into an imaginary world, fantasising that I was  or  or . I made my peace with it all years ago. They divorced when I was 13, both remarried, which I was happy about, although my relationship with both of them was always tricky. I was closer to Mum than Dad, but there were long periods when we didn’t speak. And my childhood is one thing I’m still sensitive about.\nEven if I hadn’t been, the whole experience of watching someone else pretend to be you on screen, of seeing things you remember happening again in front of your eyes, is a very weird, disconcerting one, like having an incredibly vivid dream. And the story of how I ended up in a cinema, crying my eyes out at the sight of my family 60 years ago, is a long and convoluted one. And it begins, naturally enough, with a naked transgender woman with sparks flying out of her vagina.\nThe trans woman was Amanda Lepore, a model, singer and performance artist. She had sparks flying out of her vagina because she was starring in one of a series of films by  I’d commissioned for my show in Las Vegas, __ in 2004. That was his interpretation of the lyrics of Someone Saved My Life Tonight, a song Bernie and I had written about our pre-fame years, living in a flat in north London with a woman I’d foolishly got engaged to when I was still very confused about my sexuality.\nAn actor was dressed as me in full 70s stage outfit sticking his head in a gas oven, homoerotic angels figure-skating with giant teddy bears and Amanda Lepore, naked, in an electric chair, with sparks flying out of her vagina. I loved it: I’d said all along I didn’t want a standard Vegas show, and no one was ever going to be able to call _The Red Piano_ that.\n!\n‘I told Rod Stewart to turn the role down’: Elton John in rock opera movie Tommy (1975).

This was the year Margaret Thatcher identified trade union leaders as ‘the enemy within’. In March that year British miners went on strike and for the next 12 months, Thatcher's government would deploy brutal state force to eventually break them, achieving a major victory for the neoliberal economic agenda.",

In the photo, taken at Midsumma Festival, I beam smugly at the clever triple-layered statement I’m making: GAY on GAY on (a) GAY. In my mind, George’s t-shirt had always been associated with the campaign against AIDS.\n]\nWhat was my friend on about?\nI was six years old when ‘Wake Me Up Before You Go Go’ came out. I didn’t realise at the time, but it was an historic year in late twentieth-century politics. I was instead starstruck by the soundtrack: Boy George, Stevie Wonder, Prince, Cyndi, MJ, Tina, Madonna, Bruce and the Bronski Beat. Wham!’s video was an explosion of upbeat peppy happy glitter YAY! The t-shirt was also worn by members of Queen, both in film clips and on stage.\nThese pop icons were pro-gay, pro-women, pro-Black. I could hardly believe they were rabid ‘pro-life’ anti-abortionists. Yet my friend made me wonder: what was behind the t-shirt’s gleeful allcaps petition?\nFor a lot of people, 1984 actually meant death. Ronald Reagan had been President of the United States for three years and Margaret Thatcher had been Prime Minister of Britain for five. As leaders of the free world, they were choosing death for millions.\n1984 was the year , or ‘Global Gag Rule’. Reinvigorated by Donald Trump on his first day in office,  between A) accepting US family planning funds but being prohibited from providing abortion counselling, referrals or advocacy, let alone actual abortions (except in cases of rape, incest and life endangerment), or B) refusing US funds and finding an alternative.\nBetween 1979 and 1986, Reagan and Thatcher cemented their ‘special relationship’, pushing hard for increased nuclear weapons and escalating the Cold War. It was a time of boosting Western hegemony through arms manufacturing and deployment.\nIn 1984 the US government, supported by Thatcher in West Germany as NATO tried to regain its lead in the arms race against the USSR. The four years from 1981–1985 saw a whopping 40% increase in US defence spending. From November 1983, the US was permitted to station 160 cruise missiles on British territory. Under Thatcher, the UK purchased the Trident nuclear missile submarine system and tripled its nuclear forces.\n1984 was...[Content truncated]",

I want to go out and give my fans a great show and a great experience.” Elton is playing and singing better than he ever has, and he’s incredibly happy. That’s the magic sweet spot. It says a lot about Elton and his band and a lot about what our ultimate goals were.\nThis tour’s had to stop and start. It should have been finished a year ago, last November, when Elton was 74; now he’s 76. The fact is that he and his band have been able to keep up and build this extraordinary momentum, and the fans are just leaning in so enthusiastically and so gratefully. Here we are towards the end of the tour, and as Elton says, “We’re playing and singing even better.” So financial success is great, but sometimes these things go the other way and you’re like, “Oh, this is really dragging on. And everyone is getting tired.” But that’s not the case at all. And that’s the thing that I feel happiest about because this has been the most dominant thing in Elton’s life for more than 60 years as a working musician. He’s having a ball and his fans are, too. That’s the best thing.\n**!**\n**At the end of the U.S. tour at Dodger Stadium, coming back to where he had been in 1975, you and your boys came out on stage with him. That was a very public message about your family, which was an important part of this. It wasn’t proselytizing; it was making a statement. Can you talk about that experience?**\nWell, it’s an important component in the mix of the success of the tour and where Elton is as an artist. The word I used is \\ he’s the _happiest_ he’s ever been. Not only is his voice open, but his whole _soul_ is open, because he’s getting so much love and joy from his family in addition to his craft as a performing artist. We’ve never been big placard-wavers, but we’ve always tried to live our life just being who we are and with visibility.\n!\\ was an important milestone in Elton’s life. It is the city where he broke out and became Elton John. The transformation from \\ **Reg Dwight** to Elton John was solidified and signed at the **Troubadour** because of the wonderful performance and the **Robert Hilburn** review.\nThat city is also where both our sons were born. They were both delivered at **Cedars Sinai...[Content truncated]",

I began writing about rock ‘n’ roll in 1976 for a plethora of outlets, but mostly for the Boston Globe, 26 years through 2005. Parts of what follows originally appeared in a long-gone newsprint monthly magazine in Boston called_ Sweet Potato_._\nThere were gay rockers in the 1970s, of course. But those were different times.\nEveryone in Elton John’s inner circle knew—the public not so much, until the Rolling Stone reveal. Freddie Mercury, same deal, although the physical clues were hard to miss. David Bowie and Lou Reed certainly flirted with the imagery and appeared at least to be bisexual.\n]\nJudas Priest’s Rob Halford? Everything about the band’s lyrics, album cover art work and Halford’s appearance screamed GAY: a sailor’s cap with chains on it, leather pants, leather jacket, bare chest, studded wristband and toting a whip on stage. But the band denied it for years. I was talking to guitarist Glenn Tipton on the phone in 1988 and asked about it. (Yes, it was posed at the end of an interview.) He figuratively hit the roof, yelled at me for the temerity of asking, denied it and stopped the interview. Halford came out ten years later.\nTom Robinson, singer-bassist-main songwriter for the Tom Robinson Band, was something else entirely. He wrote “Glad to Be Gay,” on the 1978 EP _Rising Free_ (in the UK) and it was included on their US debut LP _Power in the Darkness_. It was the first explicitly gay anthem on the punk/new wave radar. And, yes, it was radical back then.\nRobinson approached the topic as a bittersweet celebration, something of both a dirge and a wry music hall singalong. It was about the apparent “acceptability” of homosexuality in Britain as it conflicted with the real-life consequences and prejudices (For what it’s worth, the three other guys in the band were straight, but politically on the same team).\nWhile that is certainly the song the TRB is best remembered for, gay life/rights was just a sliver of their activist-oriented rock. And, it wasn’t all activism either. Their first UK hit, “2-4-6-8 Motorway,” was a Slade-like stomper, an out-and-out celebration of life behind the wheel, as much so as anything Bruce Springsteen had written. I only found out years...[Content truncated]",
