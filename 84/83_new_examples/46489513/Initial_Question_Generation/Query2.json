Symbolically, spiritually, L.A. is an important city for our family on every possible level. I also got sober in L.A. And the boys—it was just the right amount of exposure for them.

And the Dodger Stadium concert was shown not only to those who were there but around the world on Disney+.**\nYes, to a potential audience of 150 million viewers. That’s fabulous visibility. As Elton says, “Nothing brings people together like music and sports.” And to be able to bring his family into his show, where the music’s bringing everyone together, it’s a powerful platform. And we’re very lucky and grateful to be able to do it.\n**There’s a moment of pride in being able to have that impact…**\nOh, gosh. If you go back to the last time Elton was at Dodger Stadium, he was not happy in himself at all. He had all of the fame and all of the success and the first album ever to debut at #1 with _Captain Fantastic_. But he was deeply unhappy personally. He was starting to slide into drug use. He was not out of the closet. And, as the scene was depicted in _Rocketman_, he made a major cry for help by swallowing a handful of pills and jumping into the pool and trying to drown himself. That was in the days leading up to the to the first Dodger Stadium shows. He was a very, very unhappy, troubled person. And the thought of being in a happy relationship, that’s recognized legally, where gay marriage is legal and permitted, and then to have children… that was unimaginable in 1975. You couldn’t even remotely imagine the world would go that far. Yet look how far we’ve come. So, it was a very symbolically special and powerful thing.\n**You and R.J.

I don’t think any human being is psychologically built to cope with all that stuff happening to you that quickly, let alone me, with all my neuroses going back to my childhood.\nIn a way, it’s a miracle I didn’t go off the rails before I did. It took three or four years – and my discovery of cocaine – before things started getting out of hand, maybe because I was working so hard that I didn’t have too much time to think about it. I was always on tour or making a new album. Of course, when I did go off the rails, that happened like a missile as well.\nIt’s strange, I don’t find it painful to watch those parts of the film. They’re truthful and, unlike my childhood, it was my own fault. No one forced me to do drugs and drink. In fact, more than a few people tried to warn me I was out of control. It took a fairly Herculean effort to get yourself noticed for taking too much cocaine in the music industry of 1970s LA, but I was clearly prepared to put the hours in.\nI gave my diaries to Taron to read when he took on the lead role in the film. He came to my house, we had a takeaway curry and chatted, and I let him see them. I knew Taron was the right man when I heard him sing Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me. I thought it was really important that whoever played me didn’t lip-sync, I wanted them to actually sing the songs, and Taron had already sung I’m Still Standing brilliantly in the animated film __.\n!\n‘Welcome to my world, baby’: Taron Egerton as Elton John in Rocketman.

When I tried to record it in 1974, the session went incredibly badly: I just couldn’t get it right. Demonstrating my legendary composure and breezy good humour in the face of a crisis, I ended up threatening to strangle my producer  with my bare hands, then announced that the song was so terrible that I was never going to release it, and instead was going to give it to . Taron, on the other hand, just sang it: no threats of murder, no mention of dear old Engelbert.\nHis singing really astounded me. He...[Content truncated]",

GLSM’s founder, the charismatic young socialist Mark Ashton, would later die of AIDS in 1987 at age 26.\n1984 was also the year Bob Geldof founded Band Aid. Perhaps in line with Geldof’s vague bourgeois liberalism I simply confused the AIDS campaign with the Band Aid benefit concerts, which George Michael also performed at. (And after all, they both had something or other to do with ‘Africa’ didn’t they?)\nEven before he came out in the late 1990s, George Michael was not only a fiercely outspoken interview subject, never shying away from expressing left-wing political opinions and openly opposing Thatcher. He was also a strong, visible and vocal supporter of LGBTIQ rights, an open and regular non-gay punter in the London gay clubbing scene, and performed at numerous high-profile awareness-raising gigs in both the UK and the US. The first of these was the  – aka ‘the AIDS party’ – in April 1987, with a line-up including Elton John, Boy George, Kim Wilde (with her dad!), Holly Johnson of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, and Jimmy Somerville’s new outfit The Communards.\nIn fact it’s difficult to disassociate any of these artists from the pro-gay British pop-culture milieu in the mid-1980s. Elton John lamented bitterly at the time that AIDS had been largely ignored ‘’.\nCertainly there was little sympathy before, or even after 1987, when the UK finally launched its AIDS: Don’t Die of Ignorance leaflet and television ad (with sombre voiceover by John Hurt, RIP), and Princess Diana was photographed holding the hand of an AIDS patient.\nIn 1984 the term ‘gay plague’  in the press, having first appeared in Murdoch’s _Australian_ newspaper in 1982. According to  reports, in 1983 nearly two-thirds of the British population considered homosexual relations to be always or mostly wrong. Over half the population in the UK thought it was wrong for homosexual people to be employed as teachers, and 42 per cent thought they should not be employed in any ‘responsible position in public life’.

Sandbrook quotes a character called Scudder, an American investigative journalist, who believes he has uncovered a plot by a shadowy group to use an assassination to foment war between Germany and Russia. Sandbrook only quotes one or two lines but here’s more of the conversation for context. The first-person narrator is Richard Hannay:\n_When I asked why, he said that the anarchist lot thought it would give them their chance. Everything would be in the melting-pot, and they looked to see a new world emerge. The capitalists would rake in the shekels, and make fortunes by buying up wreckage. Capital, he said, had no conscience and no fatherland. Besides, the Jew was behind it, and the Jew hated Russia worse than hell._\n_“Do you wonder?” \\ cried. “For three hundred years they have been persecuted, and this is the return match for the pogroms. The Jew is everywhere, but you have to go far down the backstairs to find him. Take any big Teutonic business concern. If you have dealings with it the first man you meet is Prince von und zu Something, an elegant young man who talks Eton-and-Harrow English. But he cuts no ice. If your business is big, you get behind him and find a prognathous Westphalian with a retreating brow and the manners of a hog. He is the German business man that gives your English papers the shakes. But if you’re on the biggest kind of job and are bound to get to the real boss, ten to one you are brought up against a little white-faced Jew in a bath-chair with an eye like a rattlesnake. Yes, sir, he is the man who is ruling the world just now, and he has his knife in the Empire of the Tsar, because his aunt was outraged and his father...[Content truncated]",
