The farewell tour was meant to end in 2021 but was delayed because of the  pandemic and hip surgery he had in 2021.\nThe tour has so far taken John from Australia to New Zealand and the United States, for more than 300 concerts.

As Elton says, \u201cNothing brings people together like music and sports.\u201d And to be able to bring his family into his show, where the music\u2019s bringing everyone together, it\u2019s a powerful platform.

If you go back to the last time Elton was at Dodger Stadium, he was not happy in himself at all. He had all of the fame and all of the success and the first album ever to debut at #1 with _Captain Fantastic_. But he was deeply unhappy personally. He was starting to slide into drug use. He was not out of the closet. And, as the scene was depicted in _Rocketman_, he made a major cry for help by swallowing a handful of pills and jumping into the pool and trying to drown himself. That was in the days leading up to the to the first Dodger Stadium shows. He was a very, very unhappy, troubled person. And the thought of being in a happy relationship, that\u2019s recognized legally, where gay marriage is legal and permitted, and then to have children\u2026 that was unimaginable in 1975. You couldn\u2019t even remotely imagine the world would go that far. Yet look how far we\u2019ve come. So, it was a very symbolically special and powerful thing.\n**You and R.J.

I don\u2019t think any human being is psychologically built to cope with all that stuff happening to you that quickly, let alone me, with all my neuroses going back to my childhood.\nIn a way, it\u2019s a miracle I didn\u2019t go off the rails before I did. It took three or four years \u2013 and my discovery of cocaine \u2013 before things started getting out of hand, maybe because I was working so hard that I didn\u2019t have too much time to think about it. I was always on tour or making a new album. Of course, when I did go off the rails, that happened like a missile as well.\nIt\u2019s strange, I don\u2019t find it painful to watch those parts of the film. They\u2019re truthful and, unlike my childhood, it was my own fault. No one forced me to do drugs and drink. In fact, more than a few people tried to warn me I was out of control. It took a fairly Herculean effort to get yourself noticed for taking too much cocaine in the music industry of 1970s LA, but I was clearly prepared to put the hours in.\nI gave my diaries to Taron to read when he took on the lead role in the film. He came to my house, we had a takeaway curry and chatted, and I let him see them. I knew Taron was the right man when I heard him sing Don\u2019t Let the Sun Go Down on Me. I thought it was really important that whoever played me didn\u2019t lip-sync, I wanted them to actually sing the songs, and Taron had already sung I\u2019m Still Standing brilliantly in the animated film __.\n!\n\u2018Welcome to my world, baby\u2019: Taron Egerton as Elton John in Rocketman. Photograph: David Appleby\nBut Don\u2019t Let the Sun Go Down on Me is a really hard song for a vocalist. I know, because I struggled with it myself. When I tried to record it in 1974, the session went incredibly badly: I just couldn\u2019t get it right. Demonstrating my legendary composure and breezy good humour in the face of a crisis, I ended up threatening to strangle my producer  with my bare hands, then announced that the song was so terrible that I was never going to release it, and instead was going to give it to . Taron, on the other hand, just sang it: no threats of murder, no mention of dear old Engelbert.\nHis singing really astounded me. He...[Content truncated]",

GLSM\u2019s founder, the charismatic young socialist Mark Ashton, would later die of AIDS in 1987 at age 26.\n1984 was also the year Bob Geldof founded Band Aid. Perhaps in line with Geldof\u2019s vague bourgeois liberalism I simply confused the AIDS campaign with the Band Aid benefit concerts, which George Michael also performed at. (And after all, they both had something or other to do with \u2018Africa\u2019 didn\u2019t they?)\nEven before he came out in the late 1990s, George Michael was not only a fiercely outspoken interview subject, never shying away from expressing left-wing political opinions and openly opposing Thatcher. He was also a strong, visible and vocal supporter of LGBTIQ rights, an open and regular non-gay punter in the London gay clubbing scene, and performed at numerous high-profile awareness-raising gigs in both the UK and the US. The first of these was the  \u2013 aka \u2018the AIDS party\u2019 \u2013 in April 1987, with a line-up including Elton John, Boy George, Kim Wilde\u00a0(with her dad!), Holly Johnson of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, and Jimmy Somerville\u2019s new outfit The Communards.\nIn fact it\u2019s difficult to disassociate any of these artists from the pro-gay British pop-culture milieu in the mid-1980s. Elton John lamented bitterly at the time that AIDS had been largely ignored \u2018\u2019.\nCertainly there was little sympathy before, or even after 1987, when the UK finally launched its AIDS: Don\u2019t Die of Ignorance leaflet and television ad (with sombre voiceover by John Hurt, RIP), and Princess Diana was photographed holding the hand of an AIDS patient.\nIn 1984 the term \u2018gay plague\u2019  in the press, having first appeared in Murdoch\u2019s _Australian_ newspaper in 1982.

Sandbrook quotes a character called Scudder, an American investigative journalist, who believes he has uncovered a plot by a shadowy group to use an assassination to foment war between Germany and Russia.
