These rumors are simultaneously evidence of a local situation (the level of distrust by one group in the context of one issue) and indicators of the larger social context in which that distrust occurs. The content of rumors about HIV/AIDS is related to the fraught historical relationship between African Americans and mainstream (White) society, and the perceptions of the health professions as agents of White power. Understanding the rumors (and perhaps dispelling them) first requires an understanding of the different roles that collective memory and rumors play in the creation of distrust.\nCollective memory research looks at how groups \u201cknow\u201d things and sustain memories of traditions and historical events from generation to generation without formal histories or institutional education. Part of the explanation for distrust of health professions and health initiatives stems from the collective memory of racism and discriminatory abuse in US society, a heritage regularly reaffirmed in everyday experience. Collective memory studies fail, however, when it comes to the question of how alternative stories (such as HIV/AIDS conspiracy accounts) might be conveyed. Rumors are not collective memory; they thrive in the absence of commemorative events, memorials, and rituals. There is no evidentiary foundation for the story of the disease as part of a US government or CIA plan to exterminate African Americans.\nAlthough HIV/AIDS transmission rates continue to fall among many demographic groups, rates of new cases within the African American community remain at tragically high levels. The present study found a similar pattern for rumors\u2014declining rapidly among Whites while stubbornly persisting within the African American public. Just as HIV/AIDS has followed different epidemiological courses within different subpopulations, rumors and stories woven around HIV have also covaried by subpopulation with a correlation across group identity, rumors, and HIV prevalence.\nMETHODS OF DATA COLLECTION\n--------------------------\nThis analysis relies on 2 sources of data. (1) I performed a qualitative review of the public discourse about HIV/AIDS in the \u201cBlack Press,\u201d on the Internet, and in other public arenas.

Historian Thomas Boghardt popularized the codename \"INFEKTION\" based on the claims of former East German Ministry for State Security (Stasi) officer G\u00fcnter Bohnsack\u00a0, who claimed that the Stasi codename for the campaign was either \"INFEKTION\" or perhaps also \"VORW\u00c4RTS II\" (\"FORWARD II\"). However, historians Christopher Nehring and Douglas Selvage found in the former Stasi and Bulgarian State Security archives materials that prove the actual Stasi codename for the AIDS disinformation campaign was Operation Denver. The operation involved \"an extraordinary amount of effort \u2013 funding radio programs, courting journalists, distributing would-be scientific studies\", according to journalist Joshua Yaffa, and even became the subject of a report by Dan Rather on the CBS Evening News.\nThe Soviet Union used the campaign to undermine the United States' credibility, foster anti-Americanism, isolate America abroad, and create tensions between host countries and the U.S. over the presence of American military bases (which were often portrayed as the cause of AIDS outbreaks in local...[Content truncated]",
