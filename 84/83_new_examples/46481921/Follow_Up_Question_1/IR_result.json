Politics Life Sci. 2013 Fall.\nAbstract\n--------\n**Background:** When in May 1983 the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was first securely attributed to a virus, eventually called the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), many controversies arose. Among these was one centering on HIV's origin. A startling hypothesis, called here the \"HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth,\" asserted that HIV had been a product, accidental or intentional, of bioweaponry research. While its earliest identifiable contributors were in the West, this myth's most dynamic propagators were in the East. The Soviet security service, the KGB, took \"active measures\" to create and disseminate AIDS disinformation beginning no later than July 1983 and ending no earlier than October 1987. The East German security service, a complex bureaucracy popularly known as \"the Stasi,\" was involved, too, but how early, how deeply, how uniformly, how ably, and how successfully has not been clear. Following German reunification, claims arose attributing to the Stasi the masterful execution of ingenious elements in a disinformation campaign they helped shape and soon came to dominate. We have tested these claims.\n**Question:** Was the HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth a Stasi success?\n**Methods:** Primary sources were documents and photographs assembled by the Ministry of State Security (MfS) of the German Democratic Republic (G...[Content truncated]",

Historian Thomas Boghardt popularized the codename \"INFEKTION\" based on the claims of former East German Ministry for State Security (Stasi) officer Günter Bohnsack , who claimed that the Stasi codename for the campaign was either \"INFEKTION\" or perhaps also \"VORWÄRTS II\" (\"FORWARD II\"). However, historians Christopher Nehring and Douglas Selvage found in the former Stasi and Bulgarian State Security archives materials that prove the actual Stasi codename for the AIDS disinformation campaign was Operation Denver. The operation involved \"an extraordinary amount of effort – funding radio programs, courting journalists, distributing would-be scientific studies\", according to journalist Joshua Yaffa, and even became the subject of a report by Dan Rather on the CBS Evening News.\nThe Soviet Union used the campaign to undermine the United States' credibility, foster anti-Americanism, isolate America abroad, and create tensions between host countries and the U.S. over the presence of American military bases (which were often portrayed as the cause of AIDS outbreaks in local...[Content truncated]",

During the next year, we assess that the threat of violence from individuals radicalized in the United States will remain high, but largely unchanged, marked by lone offenders or small group attacks that occur with little warning. Foreign terrorist groups like al-Qa’ida and ISIS are seeking to rebuild overseas, and they maintain worldwide networks of supporters that could seek to target the Homeland. \nIn addition to the enduring terrorism threat, we expect illegal drugs produced in Mexico and sold in the United \nStates will continue to kill more Americans than any other threat. During the past year, US-based traffickers hav e \nbecome more involved in the mixing and pressing of fentanyl, contributing to more lethal mixes of this already deadly drug. \nThis year, record encounters of migrants arriving from a growing number of countries have complicated border and immigration security. While monthly encounters have fallen from record highs in December, overall \nencounters for the fiscal year are on pace to nearly match 2022’s record high total. As part of the overall increas e \nin migration, we have also encountered a growing number of individuals in the Terrorist Screening Data Set (TSDS), also known as the “watchlist.” Inclusion in the TSDS ranges from known associates of watchlisted individuals, such as family members, to individuals directly engaged in terrorist activity. \nDomestic and foreign adversaries will likely continue to target our critical infrastructure over the next year, in part because they perceive targeting these sectors would be detrimental to US industries and the American way \nof life. While cyber attacks seeking to compromise networks or disrupt services for geopolitical or financia l \npurposes continue apace, we noted an uptick over the last year of physical attacks on critical infrastructure. \nWe expect the 2024 election cycle will be a key event for possible violence and foreign influence targeting ou r \nelection infrastructure, processes, and personnel. \nAgainst this backdrop of traditional homeland security threats, we expect the People’s Republic of China (PRC) \nwill continue to use predatory economic practices to advantage its firms and industries over ours.

Politics Life Sci. 2013 Fall.\nAbstract\n--------\n**Background:** When in May 1983 the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was first securely attributed to a virus, eventually called the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), many controversies arose. Among these was one centering on HIV's origin. A startling hypothesis, called here the \"HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth,\" asserted that HIV had been a product, accidental or intentional, of bioweaponry research. While its earliest identifiable contributors were in the West, this myth's most dynamic propagators were in the East. The Soviet security service, the KGB, took \"active measures\" to create and disseminate AIDS disinformation beginning no later than July 1983 and ending no earlier than October 1987. The East German security service, a complex bureaucracy popularly known as \"the Stasi,\" was involved, too, but how early, how deeply, how uniformly, how ably, and how successfully has not been clear. Following German reunification, claims arose attributing to the Stasi the masterful execution of ingenious elements in a disinformation campaign they helped shape and soon came to dominate. We have tested these claims.\n**Question:** Was the HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth a Stasi success?\n**Methods:** Primary sources were documents and photographs assembled by the Ministry of State Security (MfS) of the German Democratic Republic (G...[Content truncated]"

Historian Thomas Boghardt popularized the codename \"INFEKTION\" based on the claims of former East German Ministry for State Security (Stasi) officer Günter Bohnsack , who claimed that the Stasi codename for the campaign was either \"INFEKTION\" or perhaps also \"VORWÄRTS II\" (\"FORWARD II\"). However, historians Christopher Nehring and Douglas Selvage found in the former Stasi and Bulgarian State Security archives materials that prove the actual Stasi codename for the AIDS disinformation campaign was Operation Denver. The operation involved \"an extraordinary amount of effort – funding radio programs, courting journalists, distributing would-be scientific studies\", according to journalist Joshua Yaffa, and even became the subject of a report by Dan Rather on the CBS Evening News.\nThe Soviet Union used the campaign to undermine the United States' credibility, foster anti-Americanism, isolate America abroad, and create tensions between host countries and the U.S. over the presence of American military bases (which were often portrayed as the cause of AIDS outbreaks in local...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What specific historical examples support the claim of CIA involvement in HIV/AIDS creation or disinformation?",
        "Answer": "The claim that the CIA was involved in the creation or disinformation surrounding HIV/AIDS does have historical context, but the evidence supporting this claim primarily points to Soviet disinformation campaigns rather than CIA actions. Here are some specific historical examples that illustrate these dynamics:\n\n1. **Operation Denver**: This was a KGB disinformation campaign in the 1980s that aimed to spread the idea that the United States had invented HIV/AIDS as a biological weapon. This operation involved extensive efforts including funding research and courting journalists to disseminate the narrative that the U.S. was behind the creation of the virus, specifically alleging that it was a product of research conducted at Fort Detrick, Maryland. This disinformation was propagated internationally to undermine U.S. credibility and foster anti-American sentiment.\n\n2. **Soviet Disinformation Tactics**: Reports indicate that the Soviet Union conducted significant disinformation efforts regarding HIV/AIDS, including planting fake stories in various international media outlets. The KGB had a designated department for such operations, and several fabricated claims suggested that AIDS was created by the U.S. government. These claims fed into broader distrust and conspiracy theories surrounding the epidemic, contributing to the narrative implicating U.S. agencies.\n\n3. **KGB's Active Measures**: Historical accounts reveal that the KGB utilized 'active measures' as a way to spread disinformation regarding HIV/AIDS, beginning as early as 1983. This included the 'HIV-from-Fort-Detrick' myth, which was notably propagated through various media forms, including communist newspapers in multiple countries. This campaign's intention was to sow chaos and distrust among the American populace, with millions still believing these unfounded theories today.\n\nIn conclusion, while evidence of disinformation campaigns exists, it primarily implicates Soviet intelligence agencies rather than the CIA. Thus, the claim that the CIA directly created HIV/AIDS or was involved in its disinformation lacks credible backing.",
