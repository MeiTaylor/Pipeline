During the next year, we assess that the threat of violence from individuals radicalized in the United States will remain high, but largely unchanged, marked by lone offenders or small group attacks that occur with little warning. Foreign terrorist groups like al-Qa’ida and ISIS are seeking to rebuild overseas, and they maintain worldwide networks of supporters that could seek to target the Homeland. \nIn addition to the enduring terrorism threat, we expect illegal drugs produced in Mexico and sold in the United \nStates will continue to kill more Americans than any other threat. During the past year, US-based traffickers hav e \nbecome more involved in the mixing and pressing of fentanyl, contributing to more lethal mixes of this already deadly drug. \nThis year, record encounters of migrants arriving from a growing number of countries have complicated border and immigration security. While monthly encounters have fallen from record highs in December, overall \nencounters for the fiscal year are on pace to nearly match 2022’s record high total. As part of the overall increas e \nin migration, we have also encountered a growing number of individuals in the Terrorist Screening Data Set (TSDS), also known as the “watchlist.” Inclusion in the TSDS ranges from known associates of watchlisted individuals, such as family members, to individuals directly engaged in terrorist activity. \nDomestic and foreign adversaries will likely continue to target our critical infrastructure over the next year, in part because they perceive targeting these sectors would be detrimental to US industries and the American way \nof life. While cyber attacks seeking to compromise networks or disrupt services for geopolitical or financia l \npurposes continue apace, we noted an uptick over the last year of physical attacks on critical infrastructure. \nWe expect the 2024 election cycle will be a key event for possible violence and foreign influence targeting ou r \nelection infrastructure, processes, and personnel. \nAgainst this backdrop of traditional homeland security threats, we expect the People’s Republic of China (PRC) \nwill continue to use predatory economic practices to advantage its firms and industries over ours. The PRC wil l \nlikely continue to manipulate markets, employ economic espionage and coercive economic tools, and seek to \nillicitly acquire our technologies and intellectual property...[Content truncated]",

Russia and China are disseminating disinformation about domestic U.S. race relations and COVID-19 to undermine and discredit the U.S. government. These information warfare attacks, which threaten U.S. national security, may seem new, but they are not. Using an applied history methodology and a wealth of previously classified archival records, this paper uses two case studies to reveal how and why a hostile foreign state, the Soviet Union, targeted America with similar disinformation in the past. The methods that the U.S. government devised during the Cold War to counter Soviet disinformation are still relevant, even in today’s information landscape. By applying that history, this paper recommends developing a new U.S. strategy for countering hostile state disinformation: through promoting digital literacy, which requires a whole-of-society, generational effort. Establishing a coherent strategy is important because disinform",

Event 201\nTabletop Exercise\nEvent 201\n=============\nThis training tabletop exercise is based on a fictional scenario. The inputs experts used for modeling the potential impact were fictional. It is a teaching and training resource for public health and government officials.\nThe Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201, a high-level pandemic exercise on October 18, 2019, in New York, NY. The exercise illustrated areas where public/private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences.\n> \nIn recent years, the world has seen a growing number of epidemic events, amounting to approximately 200 events annually. These events are increasing, and they are disruptive to health, economies, and society. Managing these events already strains global capacity, even absent a pandemic threat. Experts agree that it is only a matter of time before one of these epidemics becomes global—a pandemic with potentially catastrophic consequences. A severe pandemic, which becomes “Event 201,” would require reliable cooperation among several industries, national governments, and key international institutions.\nAbout the Event 201 exercise\n----------------------------\nEvent 201 was a 3.5-hour pandemic tabletop exercise that simulated a series of dramatic, scenario-based facilitated discussions, confronting difficult, true-to-life dilemmas associated with response to a hypothetical, but scientifically plausible, pandemic. 15 global business, government, and public health leaders were  in the simulation exercise that highlighted unresolved real-world policy and economic issues that could be solved with sufficient political will, financial investment, and attention now and in the future.\nThe exercise consisted of pre-recorded news broadcasts, live “staff” briefings, and moderated discussions on specific topics. These issues were carefully designed in a compelling narrative that educated the participants...[Content truncated]",

Spy agencies pour vast resources into hacking, leaking, and forging data, often with the goal of weakening the very foundation of liberal democracy: trust in facts. Thomas Rid, a renowned expert on technology and national security, was one of the first to sound the alarm. More than four months before the 2016 election, he warned that Russian military intelligence was “carefully planning and timing a high-stakes political campaign\" to disrupt the democratic process. But as crafty as such so-called active measures have become, they are not new. The story of modern disinformation begins with the post-Russian Revolution clash between communism and capitalism, which would come to define the Cold War. In Active Measures, Rid reveals startling intelligence and security secrets from materials written in more than ten languages across several nations, and from interviews with current and former operatives. He exposes the disturbing yet colorful history of professional, organized lying, revealing for the first time some of the century’s most significant operations―many of them nearly beyond belief. A White Russian ploy backfires and brings down a New York police commissioner; a KGB-engineered, anti-Semitic hate campaign creeps back across the Iron Curtain; the CIA backs a fake publishing empire, run by a former...[Content truncated]",

After the war ended, agents would investigate other, more serious attempts to steal U.S. A-bomb secrets, but that’s another story.\nIn the meantime, the Bureau had a predicate to take a closer look at Soviet espionage. Agents launched a major investigation to discover the potential interrelationships of Soviet diplomats, the Communist Party of the United States, and the Communist International party, or Comintern.\nThrough the case—called COMRAP, for “Comintern Apparatus”—the FBI learned that Soviet spying was a significant threat, which helped the Bureau prepare for the Cold War to come.\nThe Bureau’s domestic counterintelligence work continued full force as well, with plenty of successes. The FBI employed a variety of double agents to disrupt enemy espionage, set up radio networks to gather intelligence and spread disinformation, and used its growing scientific capabilities to track down spies like Velvalee Dickinson.\nAll of these new responsibilities required an influx of manpower—and Congress readily delivered the resources. The FBI’s rolls swelled from just 2,400 agents and support employees in 1940 to a war-time peak of more than 13,000 in 1944. Because of its National Academy training regimen for law enforcement executives, the Bureau had a ready pool of experienced graduates that it could tap into for new special agents. The FBI also brought on board huge numbers of professionals for its fingerprinting, scientific, and records management operations; its Identification Division grew so large that it had to be moved to a federal armory larger than a football field.\n!\n###### The FBI’s fingerprinting work grew so massive during the war that it had to be moved to a federal armory larger than a football field.\nThe nation breathed a sigh of relief when the Axis powers finally collapsed. Germany—with most of its troops captured and Berlin surrounded by advancing American and Soviet forces—was the first to raise the white flag, in May 1945. After being soundly defeated in the field and experiencing the horror of two A-bombs, Japan surrendered in August.\nWar was over. At least for the moment.\nA more insidious, protracted conflict, it turns out, would soon be underway. The ambitious Soviets had snapped up several Eastern European countries as war prizes, and its “Iron Curtain” would soon descend, physically and symbolically dividing east and west, communism and democracy. The U.S. and Soviet Union—the two primary superpowers on the block...[Content truncated]",

Although past administration denials had successfully thwarted disclo- sure of other disinformation capers, in this case there was a smoking gun: a memo written by then-National Security Council chief Admiral John Poindexter outlining the Libyan campaign, first re- vealed in the Washington Post by Water- gate hero Bob Woodwa d\\_ The mass media, especially the television networks, seized on the memo and briefly made it a cause celebre. The subsequent Iran/con- tra scandals, themselves originally ob- scured by intensive disinformation campaigns, shortly subsumed the flap over the Poindexter memo. But taken together, the memo and the two larger scandals have had one impor- tant beneficial effect on the public - it is now possible for the press to report the \"dark side\" of the United States govern- ment and be taken seriously. This is no small achievement, as during the 40 Cold War years the public has persistently given the benefit of the doubt to its politi- cal leaders. The consequences of this have been two unnecessary wars fought on the Asian mainland; an avoidable massive nuclear-weapons race, and the crushing of progressive social move- ments - a great number of...[Content truncated]",

It should be noted that Rauff himself proba- bly left Genoa by 1949, more than a year before Barbie arrived in March 1951 . Loftus's charge of Dulles's amnesty and its consequences is remarkably at odds with Bradley Smith's contention that \"German and Italian Fascist prison- ers of war . . . received no special benefits from Sunrise'' (p. 185). Rauff was subsequently allowed to \"escape\" and reestablish himself with Vatican assist- ance, which would seem to corroborate Loftus rather than Smith. In his intro- duction, Smith notes how CIA officials were \"more than willing\" to release to him \"the only group of OSS field intelligence dispatches which has ever been declassified by the CIA\" (p. 4). This willingness may have been self-serving; as we shall see, Dulles was actively falsifying the reports of his unauthorized contacts. 62. Loftus, Boston Globe, May 28, 1984. R.

Harris Smith notes that the leading Italian go-be- tween in the negotiations, the industrialist, baron, and Papal Chamberlain Luigi i'arrelli, was in 1948 63. Ibid. The reference is to a meeting of March 3. 1945 which in Allen Dul- les's memoir was with two SS representatives, Eugen Dollmann and Guido Zimmer.
