The answer was the KGB, the Soviet intelligence service. \n\"The Aids disinformation campaign was one of the most notorious and one of the most successful Soviet disinformation campaigns during the Cold War,\" argues Thomas Boghardt, a historian at the US Army Center of Military History who has studied the case in detail., external\nKGB political officers in the field were tasked with spending up to a quarter of their time on what were called \"active measures\". \nMr Boghardt believes the KGB station in New York first came up with the idea, which played into distrust in US institutions and rumours of covert biological warfare programmes. \n\"Intelligence meant not only gathering but using - or weaponising - that intelligence for influence operations,\" he explains. \nThe aim of these \"active measures\" was to sow confusion and distrust either within a country or between allies. He says that in 1980, the Soviets spent an astonishing $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) a year on active measures.\nIt was not the only time the KGB successfully pushed a conspiracy theory. \nWithin weeks of the assassination of President Kennedy, it tried to circulate stories of official CIA involvement. \nThe Russians tried to implicate the CIA in the assassination of President Kennedy\nIt even covertly financed a book on the subject published in America within a year of the killing. \nMany attempts at disinformation were amateurish and failed. The main challenge was crafting something plausible. Those that succeeded either blended fact with fiction or worked with the grain of existing conspiracies. \nWhen it came to targeting Britain, Moscow had help in the shape of former MI6 officer and KGB spy, Kim Philby. \n\"He would provide advice on how to do it,\" General Oleg Kalugin - formerly of the KGB and Philby's ex-colleague - told me. \"He said 'this would not work, that sounds too Soviet'.\" \nFormer KGB General Oleg Kalugin says double agent Kim Philby helped make Russian interventions realistic\nTypically this would involve taking genuine documents from Western countries which spies had stolen and then adding in a few fake paragraphs to twist the meaning. \n\"We preferred to work on genuine documents with some additions and changes, and Philby in that sense was [the] number one guy,\" says Kalugin, now based in the...[Content truncated]",

There is no doubting that fact. But what happened in the Gulf during the late hours of 4 August\u2014and the consequential actions taken by U.S. officials in Washington\u2014has been seemingly cloaked in confusion and mystery ever since that night.\nNearly 200 documents the National Security Agency (NSA) declassified and released in 2005 and 2006, however, have helped shed light on what transpired in the Gulf of Tonkin on 4 August. The papers, more than 140 of them classified top secret, include phone transcripts, oral-history interviews, signals intelligence (SIGINT) messages, and chronologies of the Tonkin events developed by Department of Defense and NSA officials. Combined with recently declassified tapes of phone calls from White House officials involved with the events and previously uncovered facts about Tonkin, these documents provide compelling evidence about the subsequent decisions that led to the full commitment of U.S. armed forces to the Vietnam War.\nIn early 1964, South Vietnam began conducting a covert series of U.S.-backed commando attacks and intelligence-gathering missions along the North Vietnamese coast.

All Rights Reserved.\n Nevertheless, Legacy of Ashes succeeds as both journalism and history, and it is must reading for anyone interested in the CIA or American intelligence since World War II. Weiner quotes Dean Acheson's prophecy about the CIA to good effect: \"I had the gravest forebodings about this organization . . . and warned the President that as set up neither he, the National Security Council, nor anyone else would be in a position to know what it was doing or to control it.\"Copyright 2007, The Washington Post. All Rights Reserved.\nCopyright 2007, The Washington Post. All Rights Reserved.\nTim Weiner has won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award for his reporting and writing on American national security. As a correspondent for The New York Times, he covered the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon in Washington, and reported on war and terrorism from Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Sudan, and many other nations over the course of 15 years. \nHis new book, ONE MAN AGAINST THE WORLD: The Tragedy of Richard Nixon, was hailed as \"[an] eye-opening study of Richard Nixon's booze-soaked, paranoid White House years and the endless tragedies they wrought\" by Kirkus Reviews prior to publication. \"It speaks volumes about Nixon that there is still more to learn about him, 40-plus years after Watergate. It speaks further volumes that what we are learning is even worse than what we knew.\" \nPublisher's Weekly said ONE MAN AGAINST THE WORLD is a \"devastating account of Nixon's presidency, drawing on documents declassified in the last seven years.... Chilling excerpts from tape recordings that have only recently been made accessible include cold-blooded exchanges between Nixon and [Henry] Kissinger in which the two debate the merits of committing war crimes in order to win in Vietnam. This is powerful raw material, but Weiner's brilliant turns of phrase transform it into something extraordinary.\"\nHis previous books include ENEMIES, a history of the FBI acclaimed as \"fascinating\" by The Wall Street Journal. LEGACY OF ASHES, his chronicle of the CIA, won the 2007 National Book Award; it was a bestseller across the United States and around the world. He has...[Content truncated]",

These rumors are simultaneously evidence of a local situation (the level of distrust by one group in the context of one issue) and indicators of the larger social context in which that distrust occurs. The content of rumors about HIV/AIDS is related to the fraught historical relationship between African Americans and mainstream (White) society, and the perceptions of the health professions as agents of White power. Understanding the rumors (and perhaps dispelling them) first requires an understanding of the different roles that collective memory and rumors play in the creation of distrust.\nCollective memory research looks at how groups \u201cknow\u201d things and sustain memories of traditions and historical events from generation to generation without formal histories or institutional education. Part of the explanation for distrust of health professions and health initiatives stems from the collective memory of racism and discriminatory abuse in US society, a heritage regularly reaffirmed in everyday experience. Collective memory studies fail, however, when it comes to the question of how alternative stories (such as HIV/AIDS conspiracy accounts) might be conveyed. Rumors are not collective memory; they thrive in the absence of commemorative events, memorials, and rituals. There is no evidentiary foundation for the story of the disease as part of a US government or CIA plan to exterminate African Americans.\nAlthough HIV/AIDS transmission rates continue to fall among many demographic groups, rates of new cases within the African American community remain at tragically high levels. The present study found a similar pattern for rumors\u2014declining rapidly among Whites while stubbornly persisting within the African American public. Just as HIV/AIDS has followed different epidemiological courses within different subpopulations, rumors and stories woven around HIV have also covaried by subpopulation with a correlation across group identity, rumors, and HIV prevalence.\nMETHODS OF DATA COLLECTION\n--------------------------\nThis analysis relies on 2 sources of data. (1) I performed a qualitative review of the public discourse about HIV/AIDS in the \u201cBlack Press,\u201d on the Internet, and in other public arenas. (The Black Press, which dates to 1827 in the United States, continues to be a media sector that originates in, caters to, and represents the ideas and issues of the African American community. African Americans invest higher levels of trust and research in the Black Press than in the mainstream...[Content truncated]",

Jones \n\n\nPublished March 27, 2019\nOne of the most significant\u2014and most disturbing\u2014aspects of the Mueller report is the confirmation that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 election, based on the Special Counsel\u2019s exhaustive collection and review of intelligence. This campaign by a foreign adversary represents a serious threat to U.S. national security and is reminiscent of Moscow\u2019s actions during the Cold War. As this CSIS Brief highlights, Moscow has long conducted an \u201cactive measures\u201d campaign against the United States, including trying to manipulate U.S. domestic politics. U.S. policymakers now need a forceful response to Russia\u2019s intelligence campaign. \nThe Mueller report, officially titled the \u201cReport on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election,\u201d highlights significant Russian intelligence activity in the United States. As acknowledged by Attorney General William P. Barr, the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation identified two major Russian intelligence components. The first included \u201cthe Russian government\u2019s efforts to conduct computer hacking operations designed to gather and disseminate information to influence the election.\u201d1 Russia conducted cyber hacking into computers from the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party, and then publicly distributed the material. The second involved efforts by \u201ca Russian organization, the Internet Research Agency (IRA), to conduct disinformation and social media operations in the United States designed to sow social discord, eventually with the aim of interfering with the election.\u201d 2\nThis activity is deeply disturbing. Moscow\u2019s actions need to be understood as part of a long-term campaign to weaken the United States\u2014Russia\u2019s main strategic competitor\u2014and Washington\u2019s relationship with key allies. During the Cold War, Moscow conducted a similarly aggressive campaign of \u201cactive measures\u201d in the United States, not just overseas, including repeated attempts to influence U.S. elections. With the Mueller report now out, the question for U.S. policymakers is whether they can use the findings to better prepare for strategic competition with countries like Russia and...[Content truncated]",

The act created many of the institutions that Presidents found useful when formulating and implementing foreign policy, including the National Security Council (NSC).\n!\nPresident signing the National Security Act into Law\nThe Council itself included the President, Vice President, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and other members (such as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency), who met at the White House to discuss both long-term problems and more immediate national security crises. A small NSC staff was hired to coordinate foreign policy materials from other agencies for the President. Beginning in 1953 the President\u2019s Assistant for National Security Affairs directed this staff. Each President has accorded the NSC with different degrees of importance and has given the NSC staff varying levels of autonomy and influence over other agencies such as the Departments of State and Defense. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, for example, used the NSC meetings to make key foreign policy decisions, while John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson preferred to work more informally through trusted associates. Under President Richard M. Nixon, the NSC staff, then headed by Henry A. Kissinger, was transformed from a coordinating body into an organization that actively engaged in negotiations with foreign leaders and implementing the President\u2019s decisions. The NSC meetings themselves, however, were infrequent and merely confirmed decisions already agreed upon by Nixon and Kissinger.\nThe act also established the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which grew out of World War II era Office of Strategic Services and small post-war intelligence organizations. The CIA served as the primary civilian intelligence-gathering organization in the government. Later, the Defense Intelligence Agency became the main military intelligence body. The 1947 law also caused far-reaching changes in the military establishment. The War Department and Navy Department merged into a single Department of Defense under the Secretary of Defense, who also directed the newly created Department of the Air Force. However, each of the three branches maintained their own service secretaries. In 1949 the act was amended to give the Secretary of Defense more power over the individual services and their secretaries.\nTable of Contents\n-----------------\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \nMilestones\n----------\n*   \n#### Learn more\n*   \n*   \n*   \n#### Topics\n*   \n*   \n*   \n#### Contact\n*   \n*   \n#### Policies\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*...[Content truncated]",

Russia and China are disseminating disinformation about domestic U.S. race relations and COVID-19 to undermine and discredit the U.S. government. These information warfare attacks, which threaten U.S. national security, may seem new, but they are not. Using an applied history methodology and a wealth of previously classified archival records, this paper uses two case studies to reveal how and why a hostile foreign state, the Soviet Union, targeted America with similar disinformation in the past. The methods that the U.S. government devised during the Cold War to counter Soviet disinformation are still relevant, even in today\u2019s information landscape. By applying that history, this paper recommends developing a new U.S. strategy for countering hostile state disinformation: through promoting digital literacy, which requires a whole-of-society, generational effort. Establishing a coherent strategy is important because disinform",
