The process of opening up the Agency's historical record began in the 1980s when then Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) William Casey authorized the declassification and transfer of nine million pages of OSS records to the National Archives and established the Historical Review Program.\nA more formal Historical Review Program (HRP) was established by DCI Robert Gates in 1992. Reaffirming the principle that the US government's records should be open to the public, the program called for significant historical information to be made available unless such release could cause damage to the national security interests of the United States. Subsequent DCIs R. James Woolsey and John Deutch, and current Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet have supported a vigorous historical declassification program.\nCIA's Historical Review Program, with the exception of several statutorily mandated requirements, is a voluntary declassification program that focuses on records of historical value. The program's managers rely on the advice and guidance of the Agency's History Staff, the DCI's Historical Review Panel, and the general public in selecting topics for review. Under guidelines laid out for the program, historical records are released except in instances where disclosure would damage national security-that is, for example, where it would reveal sensitive foreign government information or identify intelligence sources and methods that are currently in use and that are subject to denial and/or deception. The Historical Review Program coordinates the review of the documents with CIA components and other US Government entities before final declassification action is taken and the documents are transferred to the National Archives.\nOur Historical Collections are listed below.

One of the fathers of the Agency, Clafk Clifford, who later served as secretary of defense, summarized in this way: \"The CIA did have several dramatic successes. But those successes had to be kept secret, in order to enable future successes.\" On the other hand, the failures of the agency have been discussed in detail. For example, when the Soviets in May 1960 downed a U-2 plane with its pilot, Gary. Powers, no importance was attached to the fact that for years these intelligence planes had supplied the best information about the USSR until that time. The CIA suffered its most serious failure in 1961, at the Bay of Pigs in Cuba. An attempt to land Cuban exiles who were foes of Castro in order to spark a rebellion against him ended in a rain of fire from Castro's militia. John Kennedy, who was then president of the U.S., complained that the CIA had mis- led him with false information. He wanted to dismantle the CIA, \"to divide it into pieces and scatter it in all directions,\" because \"I will not be able to stand another event like this.\" For weeks, he even refused to accept the daily. reports which the CIA submits to the president. Nevertheless, almost no one challenged the CIA -- in spite of the fact that Kennedy had many supporters in his suspicions of it. For example, in 1963, ex-President Harry Truman, during whose administration the CIA had been founded, said: \"I view the CIA as a kind of shadow cast on history. I believe that we should change it.\" Senator Eugene McCarthy accused the CIA of being an \"independent foreign policy administration, which is gradually usurping the role of the president.\" \\_ In the mean time, the lives of the people at the CIA were made easy by those very people who were supposed to be overseeing it: a handful of Senators and Congressmen who, more than overseeing the operation, actually identified themselves with it and the secrets which were revealed to them. There was no one who challenged the declaration of Allen Dulles, the first director of the CIA, to the effect that if necessary...[Content truncated]",

They drafted a condolence letter for President Nixon to send. In a memo to National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger, who was secretly supervising the CIA’s coup operations, the State Department recommended that Nixon convey the following message to the President of Chile: “Dear Mr. President: The shocking attempt on the life of General Schneider is a stain on the pages of contemporary history. I would like you to know of my sorrow that this repugnant event has occurred in your country….”\nMarking the 50th anniversary of the U.S.-supported attack on General Schneider, the National Security Archive today is posting a collection of previously declassified records to commemorate this “repugnant event.” The Archive has also posted a CBS '60 Minutes' segment, “Schneider vs. Kissinger,” that drew on these documents to report on a “wrongful death” lawsuit filed in September 2001 by the Schneider family against Kissinger for his role in the assassination.  The '60 Minutes' broadcast aired on September 9, 2001 and has not been publicly available since then.

The \n\nviolent overthrow of the democratically-elected Popular \n\nUnity government of Salvador Allende changed the course of \n\nthe country that Chilean poet Pablo Neruda described as \"a \n\nlong petal of sea, wine and snow\"; because of CIA covert \n\nintervention in Chile, and the repressive character of \n\nGeneral Pinochet's rule, the coup became the most notorious \n\nmilitary takeover in the annals of Latin American history.   \n\n\n\n\tRevelations that President Richard Nixon had ordered \n\nthe CIA to \"make the economy scream\" in Chile to \"prevent \n\nAllende from coming to power or to unseat him,\" prompted a \n\nmajor scandal in the mid-1970s, and a major investigation by \n\nthe U.S. Senate.  Since the coup, however, few U.S. \n\ndocuments relating to Chile have been actually declassified-\n\n-until recently.  Through Freedom of Information Act \n\nrequests, and other avenues of declassification, the \n\nNational Security Archive has been able to compile a \n\ncollection of declassified records that shed light on events \n\nin Chile between 1970 and 1976.  \n\n\n\n\tThese documents include:\n\n\n\n\n    Cables written by U.S. Ambassador Edward Korry after \n\n    Allende's election, detailing conversations with President \n\n    Eduardo Frei on how to block the president-elect from being \n\n    inaugurated.  The cables contain detailed descriptions and \n\n    opinions on the various political forces in Chile, including \n\n    the Chilean military, the Christian Democrat Party, and the \n\n    U.S. business community.\n\n  \n\n\n    CIA memoranda and reports on \"Project FUBELT\"--the \n\n    codename for covert operations to promote a military coup \n\n    and undermine Allende's government.

The relevant section of a 1957 Inspector General report on the Technical Serv-ice Division was also made available to the Church Committee staff. That report discusses techniques for human assessment and unorthodox methods of com-munication (p. 201) ; discrediting and disabling materials which can be covertly administered (pp 201-202) ; studies on magicians' arts as applied to covert oper-ations (p. 202) ; specific funding mechanisms for research performed outside of CIA (pp. 202-203, 205) ; research being done on \"K\" (knockout) material, alcohol tolerance, and hypnotism (p. 203) ; research on LSD (p. 204) ; anti-personnel harassment and assassination delivery systems including aerosol generators and other spray devices (pp. 206-208) ; the role of Fort Detrick in support of CIA's Biological/Chemical Warfare capability (p. 208) ; and material sabotage research (p. 209). Much of this material is reflected in the Church Committee Report, Book I, pp. 385-422. (See Appendix A, pp. 65-102). \nThe most significant new data discovered are, first, the names of researchers and institutions who participated in the MKULTRA project and, secondly, a possibly improper contribution by CIA to a private institution. We are now in possession of the names of 185 non-government researchers and assistants who are identified in the recovered material dealing with the 149 subprojects. The names of 80 institutions where work was done or with which these people were affiliated are also mentioned. The institutions include 44 colleges or universities, 15 research foundations or chemical or pharmaceutical companies and the like, 12 hospitals or clinics (in ad-dition to those associated with universities), and 3 penal institutions. While the identities of some of these people and institutions were known previously, the discovery of the new identities adds to our knowledge of MKULTRA. The facts as they pertain to the possibly improper contribution are as follows: One project involves a contribution of $375,000 to a building fund of a private medical Institution. The fact that a contribution was made was previously known; indeed it was mentioned in a 1957 Inspector General report on the Technical Service Division of...[Content truncated]",

The U.S. spent massively to try to prevent him from becoming president. Nevertheless, he was elected in 1970.\nThe U.S. had been meddling in Chile's politics for years by the time 1973 rolled around. U.S. interventions in Latin America go back more than a century.\nDuring the mid-20th century, the Cold War shaped much of policymakers' thinking. Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution in Cuba alarmed Washington about communism and threats of Soviet influence in the Western Hemisphere.\nU.S. officials were especially concerned about Salvador Allende, a self-proclaimed Marxist and a member of Chile's Socialist Party who ran for president multiple times and was a leading contender in the 1964 election. He had pledged to nationalize the mostly U.S.-owned copper companies, a large industry in Chile.\nThe U.S. spent massively on anti-communist propaganda and support for Allende's opponent in 1964. The influence proved effective: Allende lost.\nBut Allende ran again in 1970. Richard Nixon was now the U.S. president and Henry Kissinger his assistant for national security affairs. They perceived Allende as a threat to U.S. interests and as a friend of the Soviet Union. (Allende's campaign did receive $350,000 from Cuba, according to CIA estimates, and at least $400,000 from Moscow, according to one book on the history of the KGB's foreign operations.) Kissinger was especially concerned about the example it would set for Western European countries to have a socialist freely elected.\nIn the months before the election, the U.S. spent hundreds of thousands on a \"spoiling operation,\" much of it propaganda aimed at preventing Allende from taking power. International businesses, most notably International Telephone and Telegraph, were involved as well, passing funds to Allende's main opponent.\nStill, Allende narrowly won in a three...[Content truncated]",

Less than five months later, 23.5 percent more Americans voted for Nixon than for Democrat George McGovern. America's involvement in Vietnam was ending—albeit in failure—relations with China and the Soviet Union were improving, and the nation seemed ready to embrace the 1970s. For Nixon, who saw every campaign as a tough, dirty street fight, this was the last election. And it was a landslide.\n\nDespite declaring \"It's going to be forgotten\" to aide Charles Colson, Nixon must have felt some trepidation. Because three days later, he discussed the FBI's investigation with his chief of staff, H. R. “Bob” Haldeman. The Bureau had already connected the burglars to E. Howard Hunt, who reported directly to Colson. \nNixon agreed to let Haldeman and another aide, John Erlichman, instruct the CIA to thwart the FBI investigation. The plan was captured on a voice-activated taping system in a recording that came to be known as “the smoking gun.”\nDuring the conversation, Nixon and Haldeman also discussed associate director of the FBI ...[Content truncated]",
