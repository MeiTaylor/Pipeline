Historian Thomas Boghardt popularized the codename \"INFEKTION\" based on the claims of former East German Ministry for State Security (Stasi) officer Günter Bohnsack , who claimed that the Stasi codename for the campaign was either \"INFEKTION\" or perhaps also \"VORWÄRTS II\" (\"FORWARD II\"). However, historians Christopher Nehring and Douglas Selvage found in the former Stasi and Bulgarian State Security archives materials that prove the actual Stasi codename for the AIDS disinformation campaign was Operation Denver. The operation involved \"an extraordinary amount of effort – funding radio programs, courting journalists, distributing would-be scientific studies\", according to journalist Joshua Yaffa, and even became the subject of a report by Dan Rather on the CBS Evening News.\nThe Soviet Union used the campaign to undermine the United States' credibility, foster anti-Americanism, isolate America abroad, and create tensions between host countries and the U.S. over the presence of American military bases (which were often portrayed as the cause of AIDS outbreaks in local...[Content truncated]",

These rumors are simultaneously evidence of a local situation (the level of distrust by one group in the context of one issue) and indicators of the larger social context in which that distrust occurs. The content of rumors about HIV/AIDS is related to the fraught historical relationship between African Americans and mainstream (White) society, and the perceptions of the health professions as agents of White power. Understanding the rumors (and perhaps dispelling them) first requires an understanding of the different roles that collective memory and rumors play in the creation of distrust.\nCollective memory research looks at how groups “know” things and sustain memories of traditions and historical events from generation to generation without formal histories or institutional education. Part of the explanation for distrust of health professions and health initiatives stems from the collective memory of racism and discriminatory abuse in US society, a heritage regularly reaffirmed in everyday experience. Collective memory studies fail, however, when it comes to the question of how alternative stories (such as HIV/AIDS conspiracy accounts) might be conveyed. Rumors are not collective memory; they thrive in the absence of commemorative events, memorials, and rituals. There is no evidentiary foundation for the story of the disease as part of a US government or CIA plan to exterminate African Americans.\nAlthough HIV/AIDS transmission rates continue to fall among many demographic groups, rates of new cases within the African American community remain at tragically high levels. The present study found a similar pattern for rumors—declining rapidly among Whites while stubbornly persisting within the African American public. Just as HIV/AIDS has followed different epidemiological courses within different subpopulations, rumors and stories woven around HIV have also covaried by subpopulation with a correlation across group identity, rumors, and HIV prevalence.\nMETHODS OF DATA COLLECTION\n--------------------------\nThis analysis relies on 2 sources of data.

Others insist that the government deliberately injected gay men with the virus during 1978 hepatitis-B experiments in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Still others point to Richard Nixon, who combined the U.S. Army's biowarfare department with the National Cancer Institute  in 1971. Though the co-discoverers of HIV — Dr. Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute and Dr. Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in Paris — don't agree on its origins, most members of the scientific community believe the virus jumped from monkeys to humans some time during the 1930s. \nSince the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first reported the HIV/AIDS epidemic in 1981, rumors have persisted that the deadly virus was created by the CIA to wipe out homosexuals and African Americans.

Genomic analysis of _T. pallidum_ further revealed the lack of certain enzymes for biosynthetic pathways necessary for these cytoplasmic and outer membrane phospholipids, indicating an inherent requirement for phospholipids from the host (_52_).\nThe increase in antibodies to cardiolipin, phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol during _T. pallidum_ infection is likely the result of a combination of antigens from both the bacteria and the host, not just from host tissue damage. In a rabbit model, _T. pallidum_ cardiolipin induced a high antibody titer during active infection (_49_). Inoculating rabbits with inactivated _T. pallidum_ resulted in a lower anticardiolipin titer, suggesting the increased response observed during active infection was attributable to immune stimulation from a combination of cardiolipin released from _T. pallidum_ and damaged host cells (_49_). Because the antigens used in nontreponemal tests are found in _T. pallidum_ membranes and host membranes, referring to these tests as nontreponemal is a misnomer. A 2019 study demonstrated that 11% of 526,540 reactive nontreponemal tests were not associated with syphilis, and in those cases, the tests were detecting antibodies to nontreponemal antigens generated by host tissue damage from other diseases (_53_). However, 89% of the reactive tests were associated with syphilis, implying that most nontreponemal tests detect antibodies triggered by _T. pallidum_ phospholipid antigens during infection. Purported nontreponemal tests could more accurately be called lipoidal antigen tests. Hereafter in this report, these tests will be referred to as nontreponemal (lipoidal antigen) tests.\n#### Treponemal Test\nThe term treponemal test was introduced in 1960 along with nontreponemal tests (_54_). Treponemal test remains an accurate description of a test that detects an antibody response to antigens specific to _T. pallidum_.\n#### Nonspecific Antibodies\nThe term nonspecific antibodies has been used in the syphilis literature to characterize...[Content truncated]",

African Americans represent 13 percent of the U.S. population, according to Census Bureau figures, yet they account for 50 percent of new HIV infections in the nation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nNearly half of the 500 African Americans surveyed said that HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is man-made. The study, which was supported by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, appears in the Feb. 1 edition of the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes.\n**Produced by the government**  \nMore than one-quarter said they believed that AIDS was produced in a government laboratory, and 12 percent believed it was created and spread by the CIA.\nA slight majority said they believe that a cure for AIDS is being withheld from the poor. Forty-four percent said people who take the new medicines for HIV are government guinea pigs, and 15 percent said AIDS is a form of genocide against black people.\nAt the same time, 75 percent said they believe medical and public health agencies are working to stop the spread of AIDS in black communities. But the responses, which varied only slightly by age, gender, education and income level, alarmed the researchers.\n\"As a researcher knowing that these beliefs were out there, I wasn't as surprised as people I share the study with,\" said Laura Bogart, a behavioral scientist for the Rand Corp., who co-authored the study with Sheryl Thorburn, associate professor in the College of Health and Human Sciences at Oregon State.\n**'A wake-up call...[Content truncated]",

It is not my role in the administration to be the supporter of it or the endorser of it. Senator KENNEDY. As a personal matter, since you have reviewed these subjects, would you comment? I know it is maybe unusual, but you can understand what we are attempting to do. Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. From your own experience in the agency, you can understand the value of it. Just finally, in your own testimony now with this additional infor-mation, it seems quite apparent to me that you can reconstruct in very careful detail this whole project in terms of the responsible CIA officials for the program. You have so indicated in your testimony. Now with the additional information, and the people, that have been revealed in the examination of the documents, it seems to be pretty clear that you can track that whole program in very careful detail, and I would hope, you know, that you would want to get to the bottom of it, as the Congress does as well. I will come back to that in my next round. Thank you very much. Senator INOUYE. Senator Goldwater? Senator GOLDWATER. I have no questions. Senator INOUYE. Senator Schweiker? Senator SCHWEIKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Admiral Turner, I would like to go back to your testimony on page 12, where you discuss the contribution to the building fund of aprivate medical institution. You state, \"Indeed, it was mentioned in a\n1957 Inspector General report on the Technical Service Division of \nCIA, pertinent portions of which had been reviewed by the Church committee staff.\" I would like to have you consider this question very carefully. I served as a member of the original Church committee. \nMy staffer did a lot of the work that you are referring to here. He made notes on the IG's report. My question to you is, are you saying that the section that specifically delineates an improper contribution was in fact given to the Church committee staff to see? Admiral TURNER. The answer to your question is \"Yes.\" The infor-mation that a contribution had been made was made available, to the best of my knowledge. Senator SCHWEIKER. Only certain sections of the report were made available. The report had to be reviewed out at Langley; it was not reviewed here, and copies were not given...[Content truncated]",
