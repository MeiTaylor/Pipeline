These rumors are simultaneously evidence of a local situation (the level of distrust by one group in the context of one issue) and indicators of the larger social context in which that distrust occurs. The content of rumors about HIV/AIDS is related to the fraught historical relationship between African Americans and mainstream (White) society, and the perceptions of the health professions as agents of White power. Understanding the rumors (and perhaps dispelling them) first requires an understanding of the different roles that collective memory and rumors play in the creation of distrust.\nCollective memory research looks at how groups “know” things and sustain memories of traditions and historical events from generation to generation without formal histories or institutional education. Part of the explanation for distrust of health professions and health initiatives stems from the collective memory of racism and discriminatory abuse in US society, a heritage regularly reaffirmed in everyday experience. Collective memory studies fail, however, when it comes to the question of how alternative stories (such as HIV/AIDS conspiracy accounts) might be conveyed. Rumors are not collective memory; they thrive in the absence of commemorative events, memorials, and rituals. There is no evidentiary foundation for the story of the disease as part of a US government or CIA plan to exterminate African Americans.\nAlthough HIV/AIDS transmission rates continue to fall among many demographic groups, rates of new cases within the African American community remain at tragically high levels. The present study found a similar pattern for rumors—declining rapidly among Whites while stubbornly persisting within the African American public. Just as HIV/AIDS has followed different epidemiological courses within different subpopulations, rumors and stories woven around HIV have also covaried by subpopulation with a correlation across group identity, rumors, and HIV prevalence.\nMETHODS OF DATA COLLECTION\n--------------------------\nThis analysis relies on 2 sources of data. (1) I performed a qualitative review of the public discourse about HIV/AIDS in the “Black Press,” on the Internet, and in other public arenas. (The Black Press, which dates to 1827 in the United States, continues to be a media sector that originates in, caters to, and represents the ideas and issues of the African American community. African Americans invest higher levels of trust and research in the Black Press than in the mainstream...[Content truncated]",

Even today, the conspiracy theory has a number of high-profile believers. South African President Thabo Mbeki once touted the theory, disputing scientific claims that the virus originated in Africa and accusing the U.S. government of manufacturing the disease in military labs. When she won the Nobel Peace Prize, Kenyan ecologist Wangari Maathai used the international spotlight to support that theory as well. Others insist that the government deliberately injected gay men with the virus during 1978 hepatitis-B experiments in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Still others point to Richard Nixon, who combined the U.S. Army's biowarfare department with the National Cancer Institute  in 1971. Though the co-discoverers of HIV — Dr. Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute and Dr. Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in Paris — don't agree on its origins, most members of the scientific community believe the virus jumped from monkeys to humans some time during the 1930s. \nSince the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first reported the HIV/AIDS epidemic in 1981, rumors have persisted that the deadly virus was created by the CIA to wipe out homosexuals and African Americans.

Historian Thomas Boghardt popularized the codename \"INFEKTION\" based on the claims of former East German Ministry for State Security (Stasi) officer Günter Bohnsack , who claimed that the Stasi codename for the campaign was either \"INFEKTION\" or perhaps also \"VORWÄRTS II\" (\"FORWARD II\"). However, historians Christopher Nehring and Douglas Selvage found in the former Stasi and Bulgarian State Security archives materials that prove the actual Stasi codename for the AIDS disinformation campaign was Operation Denver. The operation involved \"an extraordinary amount of effort – funding radio programs, courting journalists, distributing would-be scientific studies\", according to journalist Joshua Yaffa, and even became the subject of a report by Dan Rather on the CBS Evening News.\nThe Soviet Union used the campaign to undermine the United States' credibility, foster anti-Americanism, isolate America abroad, and create tensions between host countries and the U.S. over the presence of American military bases (which were often portrayed as the cause of AIDS outbreaks in local...[Content truncated]",

As a research methodology, focus groups can shed light on the shared understandings of people who belong to the same social group as well as the manner in which individuals are influenced by their peers.\nThere were marked differences in the discussions which took place in the different focus groups.

But one theory began to surface - that it was the product of secret US military research at the Fort Detrick Laboratory. \nWhat was the source for this piece of fake news? The answer was the KGB, the Soviet intelligence service. \n\"The Aids disinformation campaign was one of the most notorious and one of the most successful Soviet disinformation campaigns during the Cold War,\" argues Thomas Boghardt, a historian at the US Army Center of Military History who has studied the case in detail., external\nKGB political officers in the field were tasked with spending up to a quarter of their time on what were called \"active measures\". \nMr Boghardt believes the KGB station in New York first came up with the idea, which played into distrust in US institutions and rumours of covert biological warfare programmes. \n\"Intelligence meant not only gathering but using - or weaponising - that intelligence for influence operations,\" he explains. \nThe aim of these \"active measures\" was to sow confusion and distrust either within a country or between allies. He says that in 1980, the Soviets spent an astonishing $3bn (£2.4bn) a year on active measures.\nIt was not the only time the KGB successfully pushed a conspiracy theory. \nWithin weeks of the assassination of President Kennedy, it tried to circulate stories of official CIA involvement. \nThe Russians tried to implicate the CIA in the assassination of President Kennedy\nIt even covertly financed a book on the subject published in America within a year of the killing. \nMany attempts at disinformation were amateurish and failed. The main challenge was crafting something plausible. Those that succeeded either blended fact with fiction or worked with the grain of existing conspiracies. \nWhen it came to targeting Britain, Moscow had help in the shape of former MI6 officer and KGB spy, Kim Philby. \n\"He would provide advice on how to do it,\" General Oleg Kalugin - formerly of the KGB and Philby's ex-colleague - told me. \"He said 'this would not work, that sounds too Soviet'.\" \nFormer KGB General Oleg Kalugin says double agent Kim Philby helped make Russian interventions realistic\nTypically this would involve taking genuine documents from Western countries which spies had stolen and then adding in a few fake paragraphs to twist the meaning. \n\"We preferred to work on genuine documents with some additions and changes, and Phil...[Content truncated]",
