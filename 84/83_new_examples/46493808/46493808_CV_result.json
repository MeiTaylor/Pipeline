They have not been confirmed by anyone. They are supposed leaked transcripts. I'm gonna put them on here. You'll have to pause to read. When you see RTM, that is the real time monitoring system. This these this transcript aligns with what people like James Cameron, everyone is saying as far as them descending faster than they thought they would, trying to drop their weight, crackling in the hall. So, pause to read.",
        "Video_descriptor": "The video opens with a young woman seated in front of a computer screen, actively engaged in a conversation as indicated by her expressive gestures and body language. She dons a black shirt with red text, and the backdrop features vibrant wall art that adds a lively atmosphere to the scene. Following this, the narrative transitions to a skincare routine as the woman begins by washing her face with a liquid solution, meticulously applying and massaging it over her skin. She then reaches for a cloth to wipe her face clean, ensuring the solution is thoroughly removed. Afterward, she applies a cream, being careful to rub it in thoroughly to achieve an even distribution. The video culminates with a close-up shot of her face, showcasing the final results of her skincare routine, which emphasizes her glowing complexion. Throughout the video, there are overlays of text that hint at the conversation being related to 'leaked' transcripts concerning the 'Polar Prince' and 'Titan submersible', and timestamps are displayed, suggesting moments in a chat that discusses various operational aspects along with emojis that convey feelings or statuses. These chat scenes, presented in light blue backgrounds with timestamps and colorful elements, provide a backdrop to the main skincare focus, suggesting a narrative that intertwines self-care with serious discussions. Ultimately, the video depicts a blend of personal care and external events, successfully wrapping up with a focus on the woman's refreshed and radiant appearance."

        "Primary_Question": "What is the source of the alleged leaked transcripts from the Titan submersible communications?",
        "Secondary_Questions": {
            "Secondary_Question_1": "Have the transcripts been verified by any credible authority or source?",
            "Secondary_Question_2": "What specific details in the video align with the claims made by experts like James Cameron?",
            "Secondary_Question_3": "How does the video establish the authenticity of the communication timestamps shown?",
            "Secondary_Question_4": "Are there any disclaimers within the video regarding the unconfirmed nature of the transcripts?"
        },
        "Question": "What is the source of the alleged leaked transcripts from the Titan submersible communications?",
        "Answer": "The source of the alleged leaked transcripts from the Titan submersible communications has been deemed fictional. The U.S. federal investigation team, led by Capt. Jason D. Neubauer, found that the purported transcripts, which circulated widely online, were completely made up and held no truth. The investigation revealed that there was no actual warning or alarm detected by the five voyagers aboard the Titan before the catastrophic implosion occurred. The head of the investigation asserted, “I’m confident it’s a false transcript... it was made up,” indicating that the origin of the transcripts remains unclear, and their authorship is unknown. Thus, the leaked transcripts appear to have been generated without any legitimate basis in the events that transpired during the Titan's descent, undermining their credibility entirely. Capt. Neubauer’s team accessed authentic records of the communications from the Titan, which confirmed the absence of any warnings related to the dive process. Therefore, the transcripts should not be considered a reliable source of information.",

    "Follow_Up_Question_1": {
        "Question": "What evidence exists to support or refute the claim of leaked transcripts from the Titan submersible?",
        "Answer": "To address the question of what evidence exists to support or refute the claim of leaked transcripts from the Titan submersible, the following points can be made based on recent investigations:\n\n1. **Official Investigation Findings**: The U.S. federal government team investigating the Titan disaster, led by Capt. Jason D. Neubauer, has confirmed that the purported transcripts circulating online are entirely fabricated. They found no evidence suggesting any communications that would indicate the passengers aboard the Titan had any awareness of an impending catastrophic event, such as an implosion. Neubauer stated, “I’m confident it’s a false transcript,” which significantly undermines the credibility of the leaked documents.\n\n2. **Access to Actual Communication Records**: The investigation team had access to the authentic communications between the Titan submersible and its mother ship (the Polar Prince), which were not disclosed publicly but revealed no alarms or distress signals from the submersible prior to the incident. This directly contradicts the claims made in the alleged transcripts that described a crisis scenario.\n\n3. **Expert Testimony**: Capt. Neubauer, in his role as chairman of the Marine Board of Investigation, emphasized their comprehensive inquiry, reinforcing that after nearly a year’s investigation, they found no signs that the passengers were warned of the impending disaster. His expert testimony, alongside detailed review of actual communication logs, serves as a critical refutation of the leaked transcript claim.\n\n4. **Lack of Authorship and Plausibility**: The lack of a known author for the leaked transcripts raises questions about their authenticity. Despite their appearance of plausibility, the transcripts were categorized by investigators as a complete fabrication, suggesting that although they presented technical jargon, they were ultimately designed to mislead rather than accurately reflect the events.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence overwhelmingly refutes the claim of leaked transcripts from the Titan submersible, as affirmed by the findings of the investigation team and their access to actual communication records.",

    "CVResult": {
        "Judgment": "Yes",
        "Confidence": "95%",
        "Reason": "The existing information is sufficient to determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the leaked transcripts from the Titan submersible. The QA_CONTEXTS provide clear evidence that the U.S. federal investigation team, led by Capt. Jason D. Neubauer, has conclusively stated that the purported transcripts are entirely fabricated and not based on any actual communications from the Titan. Capt. Neubauer explicitly declared, 'I’m confident it’s a false transcript,' indicating a high level of certainty regarding the transcripts' lack of authenticity. Additionally, the investigation team had access to real communication records which showed no warning or alarm was detected before the incident, directly contradicting the claims made in the leaked documents. Thus, the credibility of the leaked transcripts is undermined entirely, supporting the conclusion that the claim about the transcripts is false."

    "Final_Judgement": {
        "Answer": "False",
        "Reasons": "The claim that a transcript shared online documents the final text message communications from the Titan submersible is false as the U.S. federal investigation has established that these purported transcripts are entirely fabricated. Capt. Jason D. Neubauer, leading the investigation, confirmed no actual communications indicating any warning or alarms existed from the Titan prior to the incident. Therefore, the so-called leaked transcripts have been deemed untrue and misleading [Initial_Question_Generation_Query 1_evidence_1].",
