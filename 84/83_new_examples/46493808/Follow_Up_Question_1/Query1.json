Broad\nLast year, a purported transcript of communications between the Titan submersible and its mother ship circulated widely on the internet. Viewed millions of times, the so-called log suggested that a series of alarms had turned a dive to the resting place of the Titanic into a heart-pounding crisis in which the five voyagers struggled in vain to return to the surface.\nBut the head of the U.S. federal government team investigating the disaster said that the entire transcript is a fiction. After nearly a year of investigation, his group has found no signs that the five voyagers aboard the Titan had any warning of the catastrophic implosion that was to take their lives. Two miles down, where seawater exerts vast pressures, an implosion would have made the violent collapse of the vehicle’s hull instantaneous.\n“I’m confident it’s a false transcript,” said Capt. Jason D. Neubauer, who retired from the U.S. Coast Guard and serves as chairman of the Marine Board of Investigation, the agency’s highest level of inquiry. “It was made up.” Its authorship is not known.\nDespite the log’s air of authenticity, the federal team saw through the pretense for a variety of reasons. Significantly, Mr. Neubauer’s team gained access to the records of the actual communications between the submersible and its mother ship, which remain an undisclosed part of the federal investigation.\nHe said that his team, aided by investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, had “found no evidence” that Titan’s voyagers had any awareness of the imminent implosion or their fate.\nHis hope, Mr. Neubauer added, is that the truth will console relatives concerned that the five men inside the Titan may have suffered in their last moments.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The transcript has been widely shared on social media platforms but not verified, and there is considerable doubt about its authenticity. Fact-checking website  has given a rating of \"False\" to the report of the transcript.\nThe transcript, alongside videos purporting to reveal audio footage of the submersible's last moments, has added to concerns about potential disinformation on the tragedy being spread online.\nTitan, a tourist submersible operated by the private company OceanGate, lost communication with the Polar Prince while descending to the site of the wreck of the Titanic on the morning of June 18.\nFor days, rescuers raced against time to locate the vessel and save the five onboard before they ran out of oxygen, but on June 22 authorities reported that all passengers had likely died immediately when the vessel imploded during descent.\nSince then, the case has continued to capture the attention of the public, with several  and YouTube videos talking about the tragic incident. In early July, videos showing what is referred to as a \"transcript\" or \"log\" of the final communication between the Titan and its surface ship emerged on the two platforms.\n!\nAn undated photo shows tourist submersible belonging to OceanGate begins its descent. The Titan is believed to have imploded during the descent to the site of the Titanic wreck. An undated photo shows tourist submersible belonging to OceanGate begins its descent.

Rush, were on board when the sub apparently imploded on the same morning, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.\nAs of this writing, due to a lack of evidence as well as no reporting from credible sources, the authenticity of this supposed transcript or log of the Titan sub's final text messages was unconfirmed. This kind of a situation corresponded with our fact-check rating of \"Unproven,\" a determination that does not mean we have concluded it is real or fake. Rather, this rating indicates that our findings have thus far been inconclusive.\nOn July 6, we reached out to OceanGate Expeditions to ask questions about the transcript rumor. Earlier on the same day, the company had announced on its website that it had \"suspended all exploration and commercial operations.\"\nWe did not immediately receive a response from OceanGate, but will update this story in the future should that change.\nIn what follows, we'll detail everything we know about this subject, including the supposed transcript itself. We'll also lay out how thoughts from film director James Cameron aligned with what appeared in the messages that were being shared online.\nFirst off, yes, the Titan sub had the ability to send and receive what OceanGate referred to as text messages, as CNN, Scientific American, and ABC News reported.\nThe following question and answer was pulled from the company's website:\nCan the submersible communicate with the crew on the surface?\nYes. Titan communicates with the topside comms and tracking team via text messages which are exchanged via a USBL (ultra-short baseline) acoustic system. The sub is required to communicate with topside every fifteen minutes or more frequently if needed.  Tracking of the sub's position (lat/long and depth) is achieved through the same system but is controlled by the computer and updates the sub's position every few seconds.\nAccording to the reporting from Scientific American, the communications technology \"allow[ed] for underwater acoustic positioning, as well as for short text messages to be sent back and forth to the surface vessel – but the amount of data that can be shared is limited and usually includes basic telemetry and status information.\"\nThe TikTok and YouTube users who shared the supposed transcript appeared to do so with disclaimers that they weren't sure of its authenticity.\nOn an unknown date in late June, a TikTok user posted a video of the messages and prefaced the clip by saying they were \"unconfirmed.\" The video has since been viewed more than 360,000 times.\nOn July 1, the creator or creators behind the GS Academy Pakistan...[Content truncated]",

Canadian Armed Forces What's next in the search for the imploded submersible?]\nThe Coast Guard probe – one of several announced since the Titan imploded – is just beginning and will concentrate on collecting debris from the wreckage and interviews. After that, the board will hold a public hearing to gather additional testimony from witnesses, Neubauer said. It will then issue a report with evidence, conclusions and recommendations, he added.\nAs officials try to piece together exactly what happened, investigators will also be reviewing voice recordings from the mother ship that carried the vessel and its five occupants, Canadian officials said.\nCanadian investigators boarded that ship, the Polar Prince, on Saturday “to collect information from the vessel’s voyage data recorder and other vessel systems that contain useful information,” Kathy Fox, chair of the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, said Saturday. A voyage data recorder stores audio from the ship’s bridge.\nThe crew and family members were also being interviewed aboard the Polar Prince, which returned to St. John’s, the capital of Newfoundland and Labrador, with its flags at half-mast Saturday.\n!\nThe Polar Prince arrives at the port in St. John's on Saturday. Authorities from the US and Canada are investigating the cause of the fatal Titan submersible.\nAdrian Wyld/The Canadian Press/AP\nThe agency’s mission isn’t to assign blame, but rather “find out what happened and why and to find out what needs to change to reduce the chance or the risk of such occurrences in the future,” Fox said.\nThe  is also investigating the incident and said it is looking into whether “criminal, federal, or provincial laws may possibly have been broken.”\nCommunications between the submersible and its mother ship will also likely be scrutinized by officials probing the disaster. The ship could communicate with the submersible by , and it’s required to communicate every 15 minutes, according to the archived website of OceanGate Expeditions.\nThe latest announcements  since the US Coast Guard announced the vessel had suffered a “catastrophic implosion” that killed all those aboard. Military experts found debris in the ocean – about 1,600 feet from the bow of the Titanic – consistent with the loss of the small vessel’s pressure chamber, US Coast Guard Rear Adm. John Mauger said.\n were Stockton Rush, CEO of the vessel’s operator OceanGate Expeditions; British businessman Hamish Harding; French diver Paul-Henri N...[Content truncated]",

Neubauer, chairman of the Marine Board of Investigation, told The New York Times in an interview published June 10. \"It was made up.\"\nThe fake transcript, which emerged at the end of June 2023, included communications between the Titan and its mother ship, the Polar Prince, during the sub's June 18 descent. The transcript also alleges the crew aboard the Titan told Polar Prince they were having issues with the submersible, before they ultimately stopped responding.\nNeubauer, who noted his team hasn't identified the author of the fake log, said they have been able to access the real communications records between the Titan and the Polar Prince. As for whether the real transcript of the Titan's final communication will be released, the NYT noted they are still under wraps as the investigation continues.\nBut when it comes to the passengers' final moments, Neubauer's team, aided by investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, \"found no evidence\" that they were aware of the imminent implosion.\nNeubauer and his team hope that...[Content truncated]",
