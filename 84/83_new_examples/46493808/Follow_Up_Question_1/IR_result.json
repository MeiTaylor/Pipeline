It claimed that a series of alarms turned a dive to the resting place of the Titanic. As a result, it threw the Titan into an emergency, putting the lives of five people aboard in danger.\nHowever, the US federal government team noted that the transcript was entirely fictional after almost a year of the incident. The group discovered no derogatory signs. This means the five passengers aboard weren’t warned of any catastrophic event that could threaten their lives.\nCaptain Neubauer denounces the falsified Titan submersible transcript\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nAccording to Captain Jason D. Neubauer, it’s certain that there is no truth in the transcript.  mentioned Neubauer saying, “I’m confident it’s a false transcript and made up,”. The Captain recently retired from the US Coast Guard and serves as a chairman of the Marine Board of Investigation currently.\nThe Captain’s team had gotten hold of the records of the actual communication between the  and the mother ship. It revealed they “found no evidence” that the passengers knew of anything in advance.\n“Somebody did it well enough to make it look plausible. The transcript made “it look like they were panicking,” Neubauer added. The log also consisted of several technical words and acronyms which then suggested its genuineness, which now seems hardly true.\nNeubauer believes that with this recent development, the families of the deceased would gain some solace.\nThe five passengers were businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48, his son, Suleman, 19, Airline executive, Hamish Harding, 58, Paul-Henri Nargeolet, 77, and Stockton Rush, 61, who was the founder and chief executive of OceanGate. It’s an American firm that built the submersible and ran its tourist dives.\nThe passengers were hoping to wreck around 4000 meters below the ocean’s surface last year in June.\nHowever, despite all odds, it seems like people still strive to explore the depths of the ocean. Especially the billionaires.\nPursuing ocean depths amidst tragedy\n------------------------------------\nPatrick Lahey,...[Content truncated]",

Broad\nLast year, a purported transcript of communications between the Titan submersible and its mother ship circulated widely on the internet. Viewed millions of times, the so-called log suggested that a series of alarms had turned a dive to the resting place of the Titanic into a heart-pounding crisis in which the five voyagers struggled in vain to return to the surface.\nBut the head of the U.S. federal government team investigating the disaster said that the entire transcript is a fiction. After nearly a year of investigation, his group has found no signs that the five voyagers aboard the Titan had any warning of the catastrophic implosion that was to take their lives. Two miles down, where seawater exerts vast pressures, an implosion would have made the violent collapse of the vehicle’s hull instantaneous.\n“I’m confident it’s a false transcript,” said Capt. Jason D. Neubauer, who retired from the U.S. Coast Guard and serves as chairman of the Marine Board of Investigation, the agency’s highest level of inquiry. “It was made up.” Its authorship is not known.\nDespite the log’s air of authenticity, the federal team saw through the pretense for a variety of reasons. Significantly, Mr. Neubauer’s team gained access to the records of the actual communications between the submersible and its mother ship, which remain an undisclosed part of the federal investigation.\nHe said that his team, aided by investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, had “found no evidence” that Titan’s voyagers had any awareness of the imminent implosion or their fate.\nHis hope, Mr. Neubauer added, is that the truth will console relatives concerned that the five men inside the Titan may have suffered in their last moments.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "content": "[Content truncated]... in depth federal investigation has revealed that a widely-viewed transcript of communications between the Titan submersible and its mother ship was fabricated.\n**Updated:** Jun 11, 2024 07:47 AM EST\n!\nThe Titan submersible\nA federal officer and his team closely investigating the Titan submersible recently declared the transcripts between the submersible and the mother ship to be “fake.”\nThe log (transcript) was viewed countless times. It claimed that a series of alarms turned a dive to the resting place of the Titanic. As a result, it threw the Titan into an emergency, putting the lives of five people aboard in danger.\nHowever, the US federal government team noted that the transcript was entirely fictional after almost a year of the incident. The group discovered no derogatory signs. This means the five passengers aboard weren’t warned of any catastrophic event that could threaten their lives.\nCaptain Neubauer denounces the falsified Titan submersible transcript\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nAccording to Captain Jason D. Neubauer, it’s certain that there is no truth in the transcript.  mentioned Neubauer saying, “I’m confident it’s a false transcript and made up,”. The Captain recently retired from the US Coast Guard and serves as a chairman of the Marine Board of Investigation currently.\nThe Captain’s team had gotten hold of the records of the actual communication between the  and the mother ship. It revealed they “found no evidence” that the passengers knew of anything in advance.\n“Somebody did it well enough to make it look plausible. The transcript made “it look like they were panicking,” Neubauer added. The log also consisted of several technical words and acronyms which then suggested its genuineness, which now seems hardly true.\nNeubauer believes that with this recent development, the families of the deceased would gain some solace.\nThe five passengers were businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48, his son, Suleman, 19, Airline executive, Hamish Harding, 58, Paul-Henri Nargeolet, 77, and Stockton Rush, 61, who was the founder and chief executive of OceanGate. It’s an American firm that built the submersible and ran its tourist dives.\nThe passengers were hoping to wreck around 4000 meters below the ocean’s surface last year in June.\nHowever, despite all odds, it seems like people still strive to explore the depths of the ocean. Especially the billionaires.\nPursuing ocean depths amidst tragedy\n------------------------------------\nPatrick Lahey,...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What evidence exists to support or refute the claim of leaked transcripts from the Titan submersible?",
        "Answer": "To address the question of what evidence exists to support or refute the claim of leaked transcripts from the Titan submersible, the following points can be made based on recent investigations:\n\n1. **Official Investigation Findings**: The U.S. federal government team investigating the Titan disaster, led by Capt. Jason D. Neubauer, has confirmed that the purported transcripts circulating online are entirely fabricated. They found no evidence suggesting any communications that would indicate the passengers aboard the Titan had any awareness of an impending catastrophic event, such as an implosion. Neubauer stated, “I’m confident it’s a false transcript,” which significantly undermines the credibility of the leaked documents.\n\n2. **Access to Actual Communication Records**: The investigation team had access to the authentic communications between the Titan submersible and its mother ship (the Polar Prince), which were not disclosed publicly but revealed no alarms or distress signals from the submersible prior to the incident. This directly contradicts the claims made in the alleged transcripts that described a crisis scenario.\n\n3. **Expert Testimony**: Capt. Neubauer, in his role as chairman of the Marine Board of Investigation, emphasized their comprehensive inquiry, reinforcing that after nearly a year’s investigation, they found no signs that the passengers were warned of the impending disaster. His expert testimony, alongside detailed review of actual communication logs, serves as a critical refutation of the leaked transcript claim.\n\n4. **Lack of Authorship and Plausibility**: The lack of a known author for the leaked transcripts raises questions about their authenticity. Despite their appearance of plausibility, the transcripts were categorized by investigators as a complete fabrication, suggesting that although they presented technical jargon, they were ultimately designed to mislead rather than accurately reflect the events.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence overwhelmingly refutes the claim of leaked transcripts from the Titan submersible, as affirmed by the findings of the investigation team and their access to actual communication records.",
