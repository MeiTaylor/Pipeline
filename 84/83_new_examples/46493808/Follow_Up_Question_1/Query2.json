Broad\nLast year, a purported transcript of communications between the Titan submersible and its mother ship circulated widely on the internet. Viewed millions of times, the so-called log suggested that a series of alarms had turned a dive to the resting place of the Titanic into a heart-pounding crisis in which the five voyagers struggled in vain to return to the surface.\nBut the head of the U.S. federal government team investigating the disaster said that the entire transcript is a fiction. After nearly a year of investigation, his group has found no signs that the five voyagers aboard the Titan had any warning of the catastrophic implosion that was to take their lives. Two miles down, where seawater exerts vast pressures, an implosion would have made the violent collapse of the vehicle’s hull instantaneous.\n“I’m confident it’s a false transcript,” said Capt. Jason D. Neubauer, who retired from the U.S. Coast Guard and serves as chairman of the Marine Board of Investigation, the agency’s highest level of inquiry. “It was made up.” Its authorship is not known.\nDespite the log’s air of authenticity, the federal team saw through the pretense for a variety of reasons. Significantly, Mr. Neubauer’s team gained access to the records of the actual communications between the submersible and its mother ship, which remain an undisclosed part of the federal investigation.\nHe said that his team, aided by investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, had “found no evidence” that Titan’s voyagers had any awareness of the imminent implosion or their fate.\nHis hope, Mr. Neubauer added, is that the truth will console relatives concerned that the five men inside the Titan may have suffered in their last moments.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Rush, were on board when the sub apparently imploded on the same morning, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.\nAs of this writing, due to a lack of evidence as well as no reporting from credible sources, the authenticity of this supposed transcript or log of the Titan sub's final text messages was unconfirmed. This kind of a situation corresponded with our fact-check rating of \"Unproven,\" a determination that does not mean we have concluded it is real or fake. Rather, this rating indicates that our findings have thus far been inconclusive.\nOn July 6, we reached out to OceanGate Expeditions to ask questions about the transcript rumor. Earlier on the same day, the company had announced on its website that it had \"suspended all exploration and commercial operations.\"\nWe did not immediately receive a response from OceanGate, but will update this story in the future should that change.\nIn what follows, we'll detail everything we know about this subject, including the supposed transcript itself. We'll also lay out how thoughts from film director James Cameron aligned with what appeared in the messages that were being shared online.\nFirst off, yes, the Titan sub had the ability to send and receive what OceanGate referred to as text messages, as CNN, Scientific American, and ABC News reported.\nThe following question and answer was pulled from the company's website:\nCan the submersible communicate with the crew on the surface?\nYes. Titan communicates with the topside comms and tracking team via text messages which are exchanged via a USBL (ultra-short baseline) acoustic system. The sub is required to communicate with topside every fifteen minutes or more frequently if needed.  Tracking of the sub's position (lat/long and depth) is achieved through the same system but is controlled by the computer and updates the sub's position every few seconds.\nAccording to the reporting from Scientific American, the communications technology \"allow[ed] for underwater acoustic positioning, as well as for short text messages to be sent back and forth to the surface vessel – but the amount of data that can be shared is limited and usually includes basic telemetry and status information.\"\nThe TikTok and YouTube users who shared the supposed transcript appeared to do so with disclaimers that they weren't sure of its authenticity.\nOn an unknown date in late June, a TikTok user posted a video of the messages and prefaced the clip by saying they were \"unconfirmed.\" The video has since been viewed more than 360,000 times.\nOn July 1, the creator or creators behind the GS Academy Pakistan...[Content truncated]",

Canadian Armed Forces What's next in the search for the imploded submersible?]\nThe Coast Guard probe – one of several announced since the Titan imploded – is just beginning and will concentrate on collecting debris from the wreckage and interviews. After that, the board will hold a public hearing to gather additional testimony from witnesses, Neubauer said. It will then issue a report with evidence, conclusions and recommendations, he added.\nAs officials try to piece together exactly what happened, investigators will also be reviewing voice recordings from the mother ship that carried the vessel and its five occupants, Canadian officials said.\nCanadian investigators boarded that ship, the Polar Prince, on Saturday “to collect information from the vessel’s voyage data recorder and other vessel systems that contain useful information,” Kathy Fox, chair of the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, said Saturday. A voyage data recorder stores audio from the ship’s bridge.\nThe crew and family members were also being interviewed aboard the Polar Prince, which returned to St. John’s, the capital of Newfoundland and Labrador, with its flags at half-mast Saturday.\n!\nThe Polar Prince arrives at the port in St. John's on Saturday. Authorities from the US and Canada are investigating the cause of the fatal Titan submersible.\nAdrian Wyld/The Canadian Press/AP\nThe agency’s mission isn’t to assign blame, but rather “find out what happened and why and to find out what needs to change to reduce the chance or the risk of such occurrences in the future,” Fox said.\nThe  is also investigating the incident and said it is looking into whether “criminal, federal, or provincial laws may possibly have been broken.”\nCommunications between the submersible and its mother ship will also likely be scrutinized by officials probing the disaster. The ship could communicate with the submersible by , and it’s required to communicate every 15 minutes, according to the archived website of OceanGate Expeditions.\nThe latest announcements  since the US Coast Guard announced the vessel had suffered a “catastrophic implosion” that killed all those aboard. Military experts found debris in the ocean – about 1,600 feet from the bow of the Titanic – consistent with the loss of the small vessel’s pressure chamber, US Coast Guard Rear Adm.

It claimed that a series of alarms turned a dive to the resting place of the Titanic. As a result, it threw the Titan into an emergency, putting the lives of five people aboard in danger.\nHowever, the US federal government team noted that the transcript was entirely fictional after almost a year of the incident. The group discovered no derogatory signs. This means the five passengers aboard weren’t warned of any catastrophic event that could threaten their lives.\nCaptain Neubauer denounces the falsified Titan submersible transcript\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nAccording to Captain Jason D. Neubauer, it’s certain that there is no truth in the transcript.  mentioned Neubauer saying, “I’m confident it’s a false transcript and made up,”. The Captain recently retired from the US Coast Guard and serves as a chairman of the Marine Board of Investigation currently.\nThe Captain’s team had gotten hold of the records of the actual communication between the  and the mother ship. It revealed they “found no evidence” that the passengers knew of anything in advance.\n“Somebody did it well enough to make it look plausible. The transcript made “it look like they were panicking,” Neubauer added. The log also consisted of several technical words and acronyms which then suggested its genuineness, which now seems hardly true.\nNeubauer believes that with this recent development, the families of the deceased would gain some solace.\nThe five passengers were businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48, his son, Suleman, 19, Airline executive, Hamish Harding, 58, Paul-Henri Nargeolet, 77, and Stockton Rush, 61, who was the founder and chief executive of OceanGate. It’s an American firm that built the submersible and ran its tourist dives.\nThe passengers were hoping to wreck around 4000 meters below the ocean’s surface last year in June.\nHowever, despite all odds, it seems like people still strive to explore the depths of the ocean. Especially the billionaires.\nPursuing ocean depths amidst tragedy\n------------------------------------\nPatrick Lahey,...[Content truncated]",

There were five people on board, three of them paying customers. Less than two hours after they began their descent the Titan stopped communicating with its parent ship on the surface.  The U.S. Navy detected a sound that could have been an implosion in the area where Titan was diving and reportedly forwarded that information to the incident commander. But that information was not released publicly. If the Titan was still intact, rescuers needed to find it quickly because it only had up to 96 hours of oxygen on board.  Over the next hour, CNN's Randi Kaye takes us step by step through the intense five-day search for the missing submersible and tells us everything we need to know about what happened to the Titan and its passengers, the risk of going so far down into the ocean, and the warnings that had been raised about the Titan submersible.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n[19:00:28] ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST:  OUTFRONT next, catastrophe at sea. Major questions still remain about the ones Titanic bound sub, as we are just learning that a top secret U.S. Navy system heard the submersible implode.  Plus, an experimental vessel. That is how the doomed sub is described in the OceanGate liability agreement that out front has obtained. So, what exactly is the submersible -- was the submersible, and others like it made of? And is that what ultimately sealed its fate?  And remembering the five passengers, humans onboard. Friends and family of the explorers join us next.  Let's go OUTFRONT.  And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, a catastrophic implosion. The Coast Guard confirming debris from the Titan submersible has been found near the wreckage of the Titanic.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADM. JOHN MAUGER, U.S. COAST GUARD:  The remote operating vehicle has been searching, it is highly capable. And we've been able to classify parts of the pressure chamber for the Titan submersible. The debris field is consistent with a catastrophic implosion of the vessel.  (END VIDEO CLIP) BURNETT:  All right. So, the mystery tonight is what caused that catastrophic implosion? We keep using the word implosion, right? We're talking about heavy pressure here, right? An implosion is what would occur underwater like that.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" first reporting that it was so powerful, top secret navy underwater microphones actually picked up that sound, coming from near the site of the...[Content truncated]",
