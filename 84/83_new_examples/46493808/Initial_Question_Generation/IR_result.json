Broad\nLast year, a purported transcript of communications between the Titan submersible and its mother ship circulated widely on the internet.

After nearly a year of investigation, his group has found no signs that the five voyagers aboard the Titan had any warning of the catastrophic implosion that was to take their lives.

The transcript has been widely shared on social media platforms but not verified, and there is considerable doubt about its authenticity.

In early July, videos showing what is referred to as a \"transcript\" or \"log\" of the final communication between the Titan and its surface ship emerged on the two platforms.\n!\nAn undated photo shows tourist submersible belonging to OceanGate begins its descent.

            "content": "Advertisement\nSupported by\nThe federal team investigating the Titan disaster found that a detailed recounting of the craft’s descent was “made up.”\nBy William J. Broad\nLast year, a purported transcript of communications between the Titan submersible and its mother ship circulated widely on the internet. Viewed millions of times, the so-called log suggested that a series of alarms had turned a dive to the resting place of the Titanic into a heart-pounding crisis in which the five voyagers struggled in vain to return to the surface.\nBut the head of the U.S. federal government team investigating the disaster said that the entire transcript is a fiction. After nearly a year of investigation, his group has found no signs that the five voyagers aboard the Titan had any warning of the catastrophic implosion that was to take their lives. Two miles down, where seawater exerts vast pressures, an implosion would have made the violent collapse of the vehicle’s hull instantaneous.\n“I’m confident it’s a false transcript,” said Capt. Jason D. Neubauer, who retired from the U.S. Coast Guard and serves as chairman of the Marine Board of Investigation, the agency’s highest level of inquiry. “It was made up.” Its authorship is not known.\nDespite the log’s air of authenticity, the federal team saw through the pretense for a variety of reasons. Significantly, Mr. Neubauer’s team gained access to the records of the actual communications between the submersible and its mother ship, which remain an undisclosed part of the federal investigation.\nHe said that his team, aided by investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, had “found no evidence” that Titan’s voyagers had any awareness of the imminent implosion or their fate.\nHis hope, Mr. Neubauer added, is that the truth will console relatives concerned that the five men inside the Titan may have suffered in their last moments.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

        "Question": "What is the source of the alleged leaked transcripts from the Titan submersible communications?",
        "Answer": "The source of the alleged leaked transcripts from the Titan submersible communications has been deemed fictional. The U.S. federal investigation team, led by Capt. Jason D. Neubauer, found that the purported transcripts, which circulated widely online, were completely made up and held no truth. The investigation revealed that there was no actual warning or alarm detected by the five voyagers aboard the Titan before the catastrophic implosion occurred. The head of the investigation asserted, “I’m confident it’s a false transcript... it was made up,” indicating that the origin of the transcripts remains unclear, and their authorship is unknown. Thus, the leaked transcripts appear to have been generated without any legitimate basis in the events that transpired during the Titan's descent, undermining their credibility entirely. Capt. Neubauer’s team accessed authentic records of the communications from the Titan, which confirmed the absence of any warnings related to the dive process. Therefore, the transcripts should not be considered a reliable source of information.",
