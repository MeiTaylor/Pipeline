Next, you'll learn how to freeze flowing water the instant support from the bottle, and your training will be complete when you can eliminate the bottle altogether. Now, this might seem slightly supernatural, but you don't have to be a master to do it. In this project, we're discovering the secrets to ice bending in real life. For this project, we'll be using these bottles of purified water. I've got the 16.9 ounce bottles, and they've never been opened, so the water is extremely pure. Now the secret to instant ice is just about as simple as placing your bottles in the freezer. I let these ones sit for 2 hours 45 minutes exactly, and here you can see the water is still liquid, but it's actually cooled down to a temperature well below freezing. All it takes from this point is a sharp jolt to the bottle, and you can see the water flash freezes to ice right in the palm of your hand. How cool is that? You can also start the reaction by using an ice crystal, like one of these ice cubes. Just carefully remove the cap from the bottle, and pour the water directly onto the ice. The water immediately begins to crystallize, giving you the power to create your own instant ice sculptures. The end result is a slush that has the consistency of a watery snowball, which of course, is 100% edible and refreshingly delicious. Now try pouring your supercooled water into a clean glass, and drop a bit of ice right in the center. You'll see the ice crystal begins to grow until it fills the glass completely. That's perfectly chilled for a hot summer's day. Alright. Let's finish up by dipping just the tip of an ice cube in to see what happens. Within a couple of seconds, it's frozen in place, and the entire cup is solid. Well, now you know the secret to pouring yourself some instant ice, and making water freeze on command. Now, if you'd like to see more of the technical details, check out my other video with tips, tricks, and things to watch out for when making Instant Ice. That's it for now. If you liked this project, perhaps you'll like some of my others. Check them out at thekingofrandom.com.", 'Video_descriptor': "The video captures a sequence where a man and a woman engage in a series of actions involving water and drink preparation. It commences with the man pouring water into a glass, followed by the woman pouring water into a bowl. Subsequently, the man adds ice to the glass while the woman adds strawberries to the bowl. The man proceeds to pour a liquid into the glass, and the woman inserts a straw. The video concludes with a shot focused on the drink in the glass. Spatially, the changes are confined to the movements of the participants and the addition of a straw to the drink. The key frames further enrich the narrative: the first key frame features a child blowing on a bottle of water outdoors, surrounded by lush greenery, suggesting a sunny day in a garden or park. The second key frame comprises four distinct scenes, including dry ice production, a man urinating outdoors with 'URINE IGNITION' captioned, a lit butter candle, and a bowl of colorful water balloons. The third key frame presents a person manipulating a glowing, pinkish thread against a dark, starry background, hinting at a futuristic ambiance. In contrast, the fourth key frame depicts a blurred hand holding a mechanical tool against a dark, cosmic backdrop with overlaid words like 'EXPLORE' and 'DISCOVER,' emphasizing exploration and creation. The fifth key frame shows a hand holding an almost-empty water bottle against a backdrop of green foliage, possibly outdoors. In the sixth key frame, a yellow, reflective, 3D-rendered high-tech device containing a cautionary triangle logo is spotlighted. Lastly, the seventh key frame displays a cocktail glass filled with a blue beverage and a large ice cube, set amidst rocks and greenery, evoking a leisurely or celebratory ambiance.

    "Judgment": "No",
    "Confidence": "85%",
    "Reason": "The claim that 'A video shows Walmart-brand water turning to a dangerous gelatin substance' is not supported by the provided video information. The video discusses the process of flash freezing water, where supercooled water quickly turns to ice when agitated or when an ice crystal is introduced. This process does not involve the creation of gelatin or any dangerous substance. Additionally, the descriptions in the video transcript emphasize that the resulting product is a slush with a consistency akin to watery snowballs, which is described as edible and delicious. There is no mention or evidence of Walmart-brand water or any dangerous byproducts. Thus, the existing information is insufficient to confirm the claim as truthful."

Next, you'll learn how to freeze flowing water the instant support from the bottle, and your training will be complete when you can eliminate the bottle altogether. Now, this might seem slightly supernatural, but you don't have to be a master to do it. In this project, we're discovering the secrets to ice bending in real life. For this project, we'll be using these bottles of purified water. I've got the 16.9 ounce bottles, and they've never been opened, so the water is extremely pure. Now the secret to instant ice is just about as simple as placing your bottles in the freezer. I let these ones sit for 2 hours 45 minutes exactly, and here you can see the water is still liquid, but it's actually cooled down to a temperature well below freezing. All it takes from this point is a sharp jolt to the bottle, and you can see the water flash freezes to ice right in the palm of your hand. How cool is that? You can also start the reaction by using an ice crystal, like one of these ice cubes. Just carefully remove the cap from the bottle, and pour the water directly onto the ice. The water immediately begins to crystallize, giving you the power to create your own instant ice sculptures. The end result is a slush that has the consistency of a watery snowball, which of course, is 100% edible and refreshingly delicious. Now try pouring your supercooled water into a clean glass, and drop a bit of ice right in the center. You'll see the ice crystal begins to grow until it fills the glass completely. That's perfectly chilled for a hot summer's day. Alright. Let's finish up by dipping just the tip of an ice cube in to see what happens. Within a couple of seconds, it's frozen in place, and the entire cup is solid. Well, now you know the secret to pouring yourself some instant ice, and making water freeze on command. Now, if you'd like to see more of the technical details, check out my other video with tips, tricks, and things to watch out for when making Instant Ice. That's it for now. If you liked this project, perhaps you'll like some of my others. Check them out at thekingofrandom.com.", "Video_descriptor": "The video captures a sequence where a man and a woman engage in a series of actions involving water and drink preparation. It commences with the man pouring water into a glass, followed by the woman pouring water into a bowl. Subsequently, the man adds ice to the glass while the woman adds strawberries to the bowl. The man proceeds to pour a liquid into the glass, and the woman inserts a straw. The video concludes with a shot focused on the drink in the glass. Spatially, the changes are confined to the movements of the participants and the addition of a straw to the drink. The key frames further enrich the narrative: the first key frame features a child blowing on a bottle of water outdoors, surrounded by lush greenery, suggesting a sunny day in a garden or park. The second key frame comprises four distinct scenes, including dry ice production, a man urinating outdoors with 'URINE IGNITION' captioned, a lit butter candle, and a bowl of colorful water balloons. The third key frame presents a person manipulating a glowing, pinkish thread against a dark, starry background, hinting at a futuristic ambiance. In contrast, the fourth key frame depicts a blurred hand holding a mechanical tool against a dark, cosmic backdrop with overlaid words like 'EXPLORE' and 'DISCOVER,' emphasizing exploration and creation. The fifth key frame shows a hand holding an almost-empty water bottle against a backdrop of green foliage, possibly outdoors. In the sixth key frame, a yellow, reflective, 3D-rendered high-tech device containing a cautionary triangle logo is spotlighted. Lastly, the seventh key frame displays a cocktail glass filled with a blue beverage and a large ice cube, set amidst rocks and greenery, evoking a leisurely or celebratory ambiance.

Next, you'll learn how to freeze flowing water the instant support from the bottle, and your training will be complete when you can eliminate the bottle altogether. Now, this might seem slightly supernatural, but you don't have to be a master to do it. In this project, we're discovering the secrets to ice bending in real life. For this project, we'll be using these bottles of purified water. I've got the 16.9 ounce bottles, and they've never been opened, so the water is extremely pure. Now the secret to instant ice is just about as simple as placing your bottles in the freezer. I let these ones sit for 2 hours 45 minutes exactly, and here you can see the water is still liquid, but it's actually cooled down to a temperature well below freezing. All it takes from this point is a sharp jolt to the bottle, and you can see the water flash freezes to ice right in the palm of your hand. How cool is that? You can also start the reaction by using an ice crystal, like one of these ice cubes. Just carefully remove the cap from the bottle, and pour the water directly onto the ice. The water immediately begins to crystallize, giving you the power to create your own instant ice sculptures. The end result is a slush that has the consistency of a watery snowball, which of course, is 100% edible and refreshingly delicious. Now try pouring your supercooled water into a clean glass, and drop a bit of ice right in the center. You'll see the ice crystal begins to grow until it fills the glass completely. That's perfectly chilled for a hot summer's day. Alright. Let's finish up by dipping just the tip of an ice cube in to see what happens. Within a couple of seconds, it's frozen in place, and the entire cup is solid. Well, now you know the secret to pouring yourself some instant ice, and making water freeze on command. Now, if you'd like to see more of the technical details, check out my other video with tips, tricks, and things to watch out for when making Instant Ice. That's it for now.

The man proceeds to pour a liquid into the glass, and the woman inserts a straw. The video concludes with a shot focused on the drink in the glass. Spatially, the changes are confined to the movements of the participants and the addition of a straw to the drink. The key frames further enrich the narrative: the first key frame features a child blowing on a bottle of water outdoors, surrounded by lush greenery, suggesting a sunny day in a garden or park. The second key frame comprises four distinct scenes, including dry ice production, a man urinating outdoors with 'URINE IGNITION' captioned, a lit butter candle, and a bowl of colorful water balloons. The third key frame presents a person manipulating a glowing, pinkish thread against a dark, starry background, hinting at a futuristic ambiance. In contrast, the fourth key frame depicts a blurred hand holding a mechanical tool against a dark, cosmic backdrop with overlaid words like 'EXPLORE' and 'DISCOVER,' emphasizing exploration and creation.

This phenomenon happened to me as well but I assumed supercooling was caused by the water in my water bottle being under a slight vacuum (the bottle was 'sucked in' when I put it in the freezer) and when I opened it the pressure change to atmospheric caused the phase change. Surprisingly I could not find a lot of data on the internet about this. My thermodynamic book has many property tables on superheated water vapor but little to say on the solid-liquid properties of water.  \\n\\\\- garrett (age 26)  \\nhouston, tx\\nA:\\nLiquid water and ice have only slightly different volumes, so the freezing point isn't very sensitive to pressure. To the extent that it is, higher pressure favors the liquid, which (somewhat unusually) has smaller volume. Since your bottle's pressure seemed to slightly rise when opened, that effect would actually tend to reduce freezing. However, it's a very small effect and in this case is swamped by the nucleation phenomenon.\\nMike W.\\n_(published on 10/06/2008)_\\nFollow-Up #5: bubbles in supercooled water\\n------------------------------------------\\nQ:\\nI also put my water bottle at work in the freezer occasionally to cool the water faster to drink.

Some panes are thicker at the bottom than they are at the top. The seemingly solid glass appears to have melted. This is evidence, say tour guides, Internet rumors and even high school chemistry teachers, that glass is actually a liquid. And, because glass is hard, it must be a supercooled liquid.\\nGlass, however, is actually neither a liquid\u2014supercooled or otherwise\u2014nor a solid. It is an amorphous solid\u2014a state somewhere between those two states of matter. And yet glass's liquidlike properties are not enough to explain the thicker-bottomed windows, because glass atoms move too slowly for changes to be visible.\\nSolids are highly organized structures. They include crystals, like sugar and salt, with their millions of atoms lined up in a row, explains Mark Ediger, a chemistry professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. \\\"Liquids and glasses don't have that order,\\\" he notes. Glasses, though more organized than liquids, do not attain the rigid order of crystals. \\\"Amorphous means it doesn't have that long-range order,\\\" Ediger says.

However, in Antarctica, ground stations are mainly located on the coast, and yearlong observations of clouds and associated meteorological parameters are scarce. Meteorological analyses and satellite observations of clouds can nevertheless give some information on cloud properties, suggesting that clouds vary geographically, with a fractional cloud cover ranging from about 50\u2009% to 60\u2009% around the South Pole to 80\u2009%\u201390\u2009% near the coast (Bromwich et al., 2012; Listowski et al., 2019).

We present experimental results and theoretical predictions for the solid-formation and melting temperatures of ice in four binary water\u2013alcohol mixtures containing methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol and 1-butanol. A dual fiber sensor set-up with a fiber Bragg grating sensor and a thin-core interferometer is used to detect the solid-formation. The predictions of melting temperatures with the cubic plus association equation of state combined with an ice model are in good agreement with experiments, but deviations are observed at higher alcohol concentrations. The measured degree of supercooling displays a highly non-linear dependence on the alcohol concentration. A heterogeneous nucleation model is developed to predict the solid-formation temperatures of the binary alcohol\u2013water mixtures. The predictions from this model are in reasonable agreement with the measurements, but follow a qualitatively different trend that results in systematic deviations. In particular, the predicted degree of supercooling is found to be an essentially colligative property that increases smoothly with alcohol concentration. Experimental results are also presented for the growth rate of ice crystals in water\u2013ethanol mixtures. For pure water, the measured crystal growth rate is 10.2\u00a0cm/s at 16\u00a0K supercooling. This is in excellent agreement with previous results from the literature. The crystal growth rate observed in ethanol\u2013water mixtures however, can be orders of magnitude lower, where a mixture with 2% mole fraction ethanol has a growth rate of 2\u00a0mm/s.

Next, you'll learn how to freeze flowing water the instant support from the bottle, and your training will be complete when you can eliminate the bottle altogether. Now, this might seem slightly supernatural, but you don't have to be a master to do it. In this project, we're discovering the secrets to ice bending in real life. For this project, we'll be using these bottles of purified water. I've got the 16.9 ounce bottles, and they've never been opened, so the water is extremely pure. Now the secret to instant ice is just about as simple as placing your bottles in the freezer. I let these ones sit for 2 hours 45 minutes exactly, and here you can see the water is still liquid, but it's actually cooled down to a temperature well below freezing. All it takes from this point is a sharp jolt to the bottle, and you can see the water flash freezes to ice right in the palm of your hand. How cool is that? You can also start the reaction by using an ice crystal, like one of these ice cubes. Just carefully remove the cap from the bottle, and pour the water directly onto the ice. The water immediately begins to crystallize, giving you the power to create your own instant ice sculptures. The end result is a slush that has the consistency of a watery snowball, which of course, is 100% edible and refreshingly delicious. Now try pouring your supercooled water into a clean glass, and drop a bit of ice right in the center. You'll see the ice crystal begins to grow until it fills the glass completely. That's perfectly chilled for a hot summer's day. Alright. Let's finish up by dipping just the tip of an ice cube in to see what happens. Within a couple of seconds, it's frozen in place, and the entire cup is solid. Well, now you know the secret to pouring yourself some instant ice, and making water freeze on command.

2024-08-04 01:49:12 - ThreadPoolExecutor-0_0 - INFO - Here is a detailed evaluation of each website listed in the "Relate_Website" section based on their overall reliability, historical accuracy, and capability to detect and expose fake news regarding the claim about the Walmart-brand water turning into a dangerous gelatinous substance:

1. **www.reddit.com**
   - **Score:** 5/10
   - **Reasoning:** Reddit is a user-generated content platform where information can vary greatly in quality. While it can serve as a platform for discussion and sharing various opinions, it lacks rigorous editorial oversight. Information needs to be cross-referenced with credible sources, as it can often include misinformation or personal anecdotes that may not be accurate. Users can post anything, so while some threads may have valuable discussions, overall reliability is inconsistent.

2. **thesunflower.com**
   - **Score:** 6/10
   - **Reasoning:** The Sunflower appears to be a student-run newspaper or a smaller publication, which can provide localized news and opinions. However, like many small or student publications, the journalism standards can vary, and it may not have the resources for extensive fact-checking. The potential reliability is moderate, but caution should be taken when interpreting information as it may not always be thoroughly vetted.

3. **corporate.walmart.com**
   - **Score:** 8/10
   - **Reasoning:** This is the official corporate website for Walmart. As an authoritative source, it provides accurate information related to Walmart's products, policies, and practices. Although it represents Walmart's perspective and may not report on controversies or criticisms, it is still a reliable source for factual information about Walmart's offerings, including product safety.

4. **www.eater.com**
   - **Score:** 7/10
   - **Reasoning:** Eater is a well-established food and dining website that covers news, trends, and advice about food culture. It has a professional editorial team, and its articles are generally well-researched. While it is more focused on food-related content, it does have the credibility to report on food safety issues. However, it may not focus on specific scientific claims, so reliability depends on the specific article's content.

5. **food52.com**
   - **Score:** 7/10
   - **Reasoning:** Food52 is a reputable website focused on food, recipes, and food culture with a strong community aspect. It provides well-crafted content, and its articles are generally trustworthy. However, its primary focus is on cooking and recipes rather than hard news or scientific investigations, which may limit its scope in addressing claims related to product safety or scientific phenomena, thus hindering its reliability in that specific context.

6. **ecochildsplay.com**
   - **Score:** 6/10
   - **Reasoning:** Eco Child's Play is focused on environmental and child-related issues, promoting eco-friendly practices. While it offers valuable perspectives on safety and sustainability, it may not always rely on robust scientific backing, which can limit its credibility. The website tends to present opinions and advocacy rather than strictly enforced journalistic reporting, so one should be cautious about information accuracy.

7. **forums.radioreference.com**
   - **Score:** 5/10
   - **Reasoning:** This website is a discussion forum focused on radio communications and related topics. Like Reddit, the information is user-generated and can be highly variable in quality. There is potential for factual information, but it lacks reliable moderation or editorial oversight, so the credibility of the facts presented can be questionable.

8. **www.fda.gov**
   - **Score:** 9/10
   - **Reasoning:** The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is a federal agency providing trusted information on food safety, drugs, and consumer health. It conducts rigorous scientific research and has the authority to regulate food products. Its website offers reliable and authoritative information, making it an excellent resource for verifying claims about product safety.

9. **www.consumerreports.org**
   - **Score:** 9/10
   - **Reasoning:** Consumer Reports is a nonprofit organization known for its product testing and unbiased reviews. It offers detailed analyses and research on a wide range of consumer products, including foods and beverages. The organization adheres to high standards of research quality and objectivity, giving it strong credibility in claims evaluation.

10. **www.quora.com**
    - **Score:** 4/10
    - **Reasoning:** Quora is a question-and-answer platform that allows users to ask questions and get responses from a community of users, which can include both experts and laypersons. While some answers might be insightful or relevant, the lack of moderation and verification means that many responses can be speculative and not scientifically backed. Therefore, it is important to verify any information found here with more credible sources.

The Environmental Working Group tested 228 brands of bottled water in 2008. Walmart\u2019s was amongst the worst.

These concerning reviews go back at least three years.\\n> I have always bought this brand of water with no issue for many years. However, I bought this brand and drank about half the waters. The taste was a little off in some and I figure do maybe it was just me. Burn I couldn\u2019t finish them because I would get sick almost immediately after drinking some. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was the water so i bought other brands and drank them jus to fine but the minute i drank this water i fell sick again. Another thing is that I buy this brand in the kids sizes for my children but this time the store had run out so I got a different brand for them when we got groceries. Well, my son said they had run out of their water (not Great Value brand) so he grabbed one of mine (Great Value water) and he started throwing up and with an upset stomach immediately after drinking it.

2024-08-04 01:49:33 - ThreadPoolExecutor-0_0 - INFO - Here's the evaluation of each evidence in relation to the claim regarding Walmart-brand water transforming into a dangerous gelatin substance, along with a RelevanceScore for each:

### evidence0
**RelevanceScore**: 2  
**Justification**: This evidence discusses a Reddit post about a weird substance in water bought from Walmart but does not explicitly mention a transformation into a gelatinous substance. It provides some anecdotal evidence but lacks sufficient detail to connect it directly to the claim.

### evidence1
**RelevanceScore**: 1  
**Justification**: This evidence ranks bottled water and does not give relevant information about specific claims of gelatinous transformation in Walmart-brand water. Its content focuses on evaluations of various water brands without engaging with the claim.

### evidence2
**RelevanceScore**: 0  
**Justification**: This documentation concerns regulations for over-the-counter drugs and dietary supplements supplied to Walmart, which does not relate to any claims regarding water products or substance changes at all.

### evidence3
**RelevanceScore**: 0  
**Justification**: This evidence discusses chicken stock and transparency in food manufacturing, which has no connection to the claim regarding Walmart-brand water turning into gelatin.

### evidence4
**RelevanceScore**: 0  
**Justification**: This evidence pertains to chicken texture issues and does not relate to the subject of Walmart-brand water or any transformation claims. There’s no relevant connection to the claim.

### evidence5
**RelevanceScore**: 6  
**Justification**: This evidence discusses consumer reports of bad tastes and sickness related to Walmart's Great Value bottled water, indicating potential quality issues. Although it does not address the gelatin substance transformation directly, it raises concerns about the quality and safety of the water, adding relevant context for evaluating the claim.

### evidence6
**RelevanceScore**: 0  
**Justification**: This evidence is about lawn and garden batteries sold at Walmart and has no relevance to the claim regarding water.

### evidence7
**RelevanceScore**: 0  
**Justification**: This evidence pertains to FDA updates on hand sanitizers and again does not connect to any claims regarding water or its transformation.

### evidence8
**RelevanceScore**: 4  
**Justification**: This evidence reports on bottled water testing for heavy metals and PFAS but does not directly relate to gelatinous transformations. However, it emphasizes potential issues in bottled water safety, which can be indirectly relevant for understanding the quality concerns that the claim might stem from.

### evidence9
**RelevanceScore**: 0  
**Justification**: This evidence discusses texture issues in chicken purchased from Walmart. It does not pertain to bottled water or any relevant claims of transformation into gelatin.

In summary:
- Evidence most relevant to the claim comes from anecdotal reports and quality concerns regarding Walmart-brand water and its safety, while other evidence is either unrelated or provides insufficient context to evaluate the claim.

Next, you'll learn how to freeze flowing water the instant support from the bottle, and your training will be complete when you can eliminate the bottle altogether. Now, this might seem slightly supernatural, but you don't have to be a master to do it. In this project, we're discovering the secrets to ice bending in real life. For this project, we'll be using these bottles of purified water. I've got the 16.9 ounce bottles, and they've never been opened, so the water is extremely pure. Now the secret to instant ice is just about as simple as placing your bottles in the freezer. I let these ones sit for 2 hours 45 minutes exactly, and here you can see the water is still liquid, but it's actually cooled down to a temperature well below freezing. All it takes from this point is a sharp jolt to the bottle, and you can see the water flash freezes to ice right in the palm of your hand. How cool is that? You can also start the reaction by using an ice crystal, like one of these ice cubes. Just carefully remove the cap from the bottle, and pour the water directly onto the ice. The water immediately begins to crystallize, giving you the power to create your own instant ice sculptures. The end result is a slush that has the consistency of a watery snowball, which of course, is 100% edible and refreshingly delicious. Now try pouring your supercooled water into a clean glass, and drop a bit of ice right in the center. You'll see the ice crystal begins to grow until it fills the glass completely. That's perfectly chilled for a hot summer's day. Alright. Let's finish up by dipping just the tip of an ice cube in to see what happens. Within a couple of seconds, it's frozen in place, and the entire cup is solid. Well, now you know the secret to pouring yourself some instant ice, and making water freeze on command. Now, if you'd like to see more of the technical details, check out my other video with tips, tricks, and things to watch out for when making Instant Ice. That's it for now.

  "Video_descriptor": "The video captures a sequence where a man and a woman engage in a series of actions involving water and drink preparation. It commences with the man pouring water into a glass, followed by the woman pouring water into a bowl. Subsequently, the man adds ice to the glass while the woman adds strawberries to the bowl. The man proceeds to pour a liquid into the glass, and the woman inserts a straw. The video concludes with a shot focused on the drink in the glass. Spatially, the changes are confined to the movements of the participants and the addition of a straw to the drink. The key frames further enrich the narrative: the first key frame features a child blowing on a bottle of water outdoors, surrounded by lush greenery, suggesting a sunny day in a garden or park. The second key frame comprises four distinct scenes, including dry ice production, a man urinating outdoors with 'URINE IGNITION' captioned, a lit butter candle, and a bowl of colorful water balloons. The third key frame presents a person manipulating a glowing, pinkish thread against a dark, starry background, hinting at a futuristic ambiance. In contrast, the fourth key frame depicts a blurred hand holding a mechanical tool against a dark, cosmic backdrop with overlaid words like 'EXPLORE' and 'DISCOVER,' emphasizing exploration and creation. The fifth key frame shows a hand holding an almost-empty water bottle against a backdrop of green foliage, possibly outdoors. In the sixth key frame, a yellow, reflective, 3D-rendered high-tech device containing a cautionary triangle logo is spotlighted. Lastly, the seventh key frame displays a cocktail glass filled with a blue beverage and a large ice cube, set amidst rocks and greenery, evoking a leisurely or celebratory ambiance. These key frames collectively provide diverse and intriguing visual elements that enhance the video's narrative of water manipulation and drink preparation, offering glimpses of playful, futuristic, and natural themes throughout the presentation."

These concerning reviews go back at least three years.\n> I have always bought this brand of water with no issue for many years. However, I bought this brand and drank about half the waters. The taste was a little off in some and I figure do maybe it was just me. Burn I couldn\u2019t finish them because I would get sick almost immediately after drinking some. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was the water so i bought other brands and drank them jus to fine but the minute i drank this water i fell sick again. Another thing is that I buy this brand in the kids sizes for my children but this time the store had run out so I got a different brand for them when we got groceries. Well, my son said they had run out of their water (not Great Value brand) so he grabbed one of mine (Great Value water) and he started throwing up and with an upset stomach immediately after drinking it. None of us have the flu or anything else. I told him no to drink the waters. I\u2019m looking for a place to test the water because something is wrong.\n> \n> I have been buying this water for a while this last time...[Content truncated]"

Next, you'll learn how to freeze flowing water the instant support from the bottle, and your training will be complete when you can eliminate the bottle altogether. Now, this might seem slightly supernatural, but you don't have to be a master to do it. In this project, we're discovering the secrets to ice bending in real life. For this project, we'll be using these bottles of purified water. I've got the 16.9 ounce bottles, and they've never been opened, so the water is extremely pure. Now the secret to instant ice is just about as simple as placing your bottles in the freezer. I let these ones sit for 2 hours 45 minutes exactly, and here you can see the water is still liquid, but it's actually cooled down to a temperature well below freezing. All it takes from this point is a sharp jolt to the bottle, and you can see the water flash freezes to ice right in the palm of your hand. How cool is that? You can also start the reaction by using an ice crystal, like one of these ice cubes. Just carefully remove the cap from the bottle, and pour the water directly onto the ice. The water immediately begins to crystallize, giving you the power to create your own instant ice sculptures. The end result is a slush that has the consistency of a watery snowball, which of course, is 100% edible and refreshingly delicious. Now try pouring your supercooled water into a clean glass, and drop a bit of ice right in the center. You'll see the ice crystal begins to grow until it fills the glass completely. That's perfectly chilled for a hot summer's day. Alright. Let's finish up by dipping just the tip of an ice cube in to see what happens. Within a couple of seconds, it's frozen in place, and the entire cup is solid. Well, now you know the secret to pouring yourself some instant ice, and making water freeze on command. Now, if you'd like to see more of the technical details, check out my other video with tips, tricks, and things to watch out for when making Instant Ice. That's it for now. If you liked this project, perhaps you'll like some of my others. Check them out at thekingofrandom.com.", 'Video_descriptor': "The video captures a sequence where a man and a woman engage in a series of actions involving water and drink preparation. It commences with the man pouring water into a glass, followed by the woman pouring water into a bowl. Subsequently, the man adds ice to the glass while the woman adds strawberries to the bowl. The man proceeds to pour a liquid into the glass, and the woman inserts a straw. The video concludes with a shot focused on the drink in the glass. Spatially, the changes are confined to the movements of the participants and the addition of a straw to the drink. The key frames further enrich the narrative: the first key frame features a child blowing on a bottle of water outdoors, surrounded by lush greenery, suggesting a sunny day in a garden or park. The second key frame comprises four distinct scenes, including dry ice production, a man urinating outdoors with 'URINE IGNITION' captioned, a lit butter candle, and a bowl of colorful water balloons. The third key frame presents a person manipulating a glowing, pinkish thread against a dark, starry background, hinting at a futuristic ambiance. In contrast, the fourth key frame depicts a blurred hand holding a mechanical tool against a dark, cosmic backdrop with overlaid words like 'EXPLORE' and 'DISCOVER,' emphasizing exploration and creation. The fifth key frame shows a hand holding an almost-empty water bottle against a backdrop of green foliage, possibly outdoors. In the sixth key frame, a yellow, reflective, 3D-rendered high-tech device containing a cautionary triangle logo is spotlighted. Lastly, the seventh key frame displays a cocktail glass filled with a blue beverage and a large ice cube, set amidst rocks and greenery, evoking a leisurely or celebratory ambiance.

In the morning, I take it out and drink it. Sometimes its frozen solid, sometimes it stays liquid, depending on when I put it in there. But here\u2019s the kicker, sometimes I will pull the bottle out, it will be liquid, but as soon as I open it, it starts to turn into ice, from the top down (it takes a few seconds for the entire bottle to freeze. Is there an explanation for this?  \\n\\\\- Greg (age 26)  \\nArmy, Iraq\\nA:\\nWe suspect that what\u2019s happening here is that the water in the bottles which did not freeze overnight was \\\"supercooled.\\\" Water normally freezes when it is cooled below 0 degrees Celsius, forming ice crystals. Ice crystals form more easily when they grow on existing ice crystals -- the water molecules like to pack themselves in place on a crystal that\u2019s already gotten started. It doesn\u2019t take much to start the crystallization process going -- a little piece of dust or other impurity in the water, or even a scratch on the bottle are sometimes all it takes to get ice crystals growing. The process of starting off a crystal is called \\\"nucleation.\\\"\\nIn the absence of impurities in the water and imperfections in the bottle, the water can get \\\"stuck\\\" in its liquid state as it cools off, even below its freezing point. We say this supercooled state is \\\"metastable.\\\" The water will stay liquid until something comes along to nucleate crystal growth. A speck of dust, or a flake of frost from the screw-cap falling into the bottle are enough to get the freezing going, and the crystals will build on each other and spread through the water in the bottle.\\nWater releases 80 calories per gram when turning from a liquid to a solid. We suspect your freezer is only a few degrees Celsius below zero(perhaps ten or fifteen?), and the specific heat of water is one...[Content truncated]\"\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"evidence1\": {\n            \"title\": \"Can anyone explain this freezing water bottle? : r/science\",\n            \"link\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/fh3m0/can_anyone_explain_this_freezing_water_bottle/\",\n            \"displayLink\": \"www.reddit.com\",\n            \"snippet\": \"Feb 7, 2011 ...

Ascorbic acid may be used in its pure form or in commercial mixtures with sugars.\\n*   Soaking the fruit in dilute vinegar solutions or coating the fruit with sugar and lemon juice doesn't prevent browning as effectively as treatment with ascorbic acid.\\n### Limit air\u00a0during freezing\\nAir exposure can cause frozen products to develop rancid oxidative flavors. Keep frozen food in airtight containers or use wrapping material that does not permit air to pass into the product. Also,\u00a0remove as much air as possible from the freezer bag or container to reduce the amount of air in contact with the product.\\nChanges in texture during freezing\\n----------------------------------\\nWater makes up over 90 percent of the weight of most fruits and vegetables. Water and other chemicals are held within the fairly rigid cell walls that give structure\u00a0and texture to the fruit or vegetable. When you freeze fruits and vegetables you actually are freezing the water in the plant cells.\\nWhen the water freezes, it expands and the ice crystals cause the cell walls to rupture. So the texture of thawed produce is much softer than when it was raw. This is particularly true of food that is usually eaten raw. For example, when a frozen tomato is thawed, it becomes mushy and watery.\\nCelery and lettuce are not usually frozen because of this and we suggest that you serve frozen fruits before they have completely thawed. Partially thawed fruit is more appetizing when the effect of freezing on the fruit tissue is less noticeable.\\nTextural changes due to freezing are not as apparent in products that are cooked before eating because cooking also softens cell walls. These changes are also less noticeable in high starch vegetables, such as peas, corn\u00a0and lima beans.\\n### Freeze food as quickly as possible\\n*   Avoid mushy fruits and vegetables by freezing produce as quickly as possible.\\n*   In rapid freezing, a large number of small ice crystals are formed. Small ice crystals produce less cell wall rupture than slow freezing, which produces only a few large ice crystals.\\n*   Some home freezer manuals recommend that you set the freezer temperature...[Content truncated]\"\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"evidence6\": {\n            \"title\": \"How to Make a Self-Freezing Coca-Cola Slushy (Or Any Kind of ...\",\n            \"link\": \"https://food-hacks.wonderhowto.com/how-to/make-self-freezing-coca-cola-slushy-or-any-kind-instant-soda-slurpee-0147581/\",\n            \"displayLink\": \"food-hacks.wonderhowto.com\",\n            \"snippet\": \"Jun 20, 2013 ...

That's because it needs something to kick-start the freezing process and encourage a small number of the liquid molecules to get together in a regular arrangement, as they do in a crystal, instead of moving around independently as they do in the liquid.\\nThe process is called nucleation, because it encourages the molecules in the liquid to form a crystal-like nucleus onto which others can then latch. The kick-start can be given by a piece of dust, a rough spot on the surface of a container, or the shock wave generated when you hit a bottle just out of the freezer. Shock waves from an in-built metallic 'clicker' are used in a new 'wine warmer' which contains a supercooled liquid that releases heat as it solidifies.\\n**Read more:**\\n*   \\n*   \\n_**Subscribe** to  for fascinating new Q&As every month and follow  on Twitter for your daily dose of fun science facts._\\nShare this article\\n------------------\\n!\\n*    Facebook]\\n*    Twitter]\\n*    Instagram]\\n*    Pinterest]\\n*    Youtube]\\n*    RSS]\\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\nThis website is owned and published by Our Media Ltd. www.ourmedia.co.uk\\n\u00a9 Our Media 2024\\n!\"\n        }\n    }\n]",

"Claim": "A video shows Walmart-brand water turning to a dangerous gelatin substance.",
"Video_information": {"video_date": 20130606.0, "platform": "youtube", "video_headline": "Instant Ice - Waterbending In Real Life!", "video_transcript": "In just 3 easy steps, you'll be able to flash freeze a bottle of water just by touching it. Next, you'll learn how to freeze flowing water the instant support from the bottle, and your training will be complete when you can eliminate the bottle altogether. Now, this might seem slightly supernatural, but you don't have to be a master to do it. In this project, we're discovering the secrets to ice bending in real life. For this project, we'll be using these bottles of purified water. I've got the 16.9 ounce bottles, and they've never been opened, so the water is extremely pure. Now the secret to instant ice is just about as simple as placing your bottles in the freezer. I let these ones sit for 2 hours 45 minutes exactly, and here you can see the water is still liquid, but it's actually cooled down to a temperature well below freezing. All it takes from this point is a sharp jolt to the bottle, and you can see the water flash freezes to ice right in the palm of your hand. How cool is that? You can also start the reaction by using an ice crystal, like one of these ice cubes. Just carefully remove the cap from the bottle, and pour the water directly onto the ice. The water immediately begins to crystallize, giving you the power to create your own instant ice sculptures. The end result is a slush that has the consistency of a watery snowball, which of course, is 100% edible and refreshingly delicious. Now try pouring your supercooled water into a clean glass, and drop a bit of ice right in the center. You'll see the ice crystal begins to grow until it fills the glass completely. That's perfectly chilled for a hot summer's day. Alright. Let's finish up by dipping just the tip of an ice cube in to see what happens. Within a couple of seconds, it's frozen in place, and the entire cup is solid. Well, now you know the secret to pouring yourself some instant ice, and making water freeze on command. Now, if you'd like to see more of the technical details, check out my other video with tips, tricks, and things to watch out for when making Instant Ice. That's it for now. If you liked this project, perhaps you'll like some of my others. Check them out at thekingofrandom.com.", "Video_descriptor": "The video captures a sequence where a man and a woman engage in a series of actions involving water and drink preparation. It commences with the man pouring water into a glass, followed by the woman pouring water into a bowl. Subsequently, the man adds ice to the glass while the woman adds strawberries to the bowl. The man proceeds to pour a liquid into the glass, and the woman inserts a straw. The video concludes with a shot focused on the drink in the glass. Spatially, the changes are confined to the movements of the participants and the addition of a straw to the drink. The key frames further enrich the narrative: the first key frame features a child blowing on a bottle of water outdoors, surrounded by lush greenery, suggesting a sunny day in a garden or park. The second key frame comprises four distinct scenes, including dry ice production, a man urinating outdoors with 'URINE IGNITION' captioned, a lit butter candle, and a bowl of colorful water balloons. The third key frame presents a person manipulating a glowing, pinkish thread against a dark, starry background, hinting at a futuristic ambiance. In contrast, the fourth key frame depicts a blurred hand holding a mechanical tool against a dark, cosmic backdrop with overlaid words like 'EXPLORE' and 'DISCOVER,' emphasizing exploration and creation. The fifth key frame shows a hand holding an almost-empty water bottle against a backdrop of green foliage, possibly outdoors. In the sixth key frame, a yellow, reflective, 3D-rendered high-tech device containing a cautionary triangle logo is spotlighted. Lastly, the seventh key frame displays a cocktail glass filled with a blue beverage and a large ice cube, set amidst rocks and greenery, evoking a leisurely or celebratory ambiance. These key frames collectively provide diverse and intriguing visual elements that enhance the video's narrative of water manipulation and drink preparation, offering glimpses of playful, futuristic, and natural themes throughout the presentation."},

2024-08-04 01:50:59 - ThreadPoolExecutor-3_1 - INFO - ################## Process RelevanceScore Output (Attempt 1) ##################
2024-08-04 01:50:59 - ThreadPoolExecutor-3_1 - INFO - Here are the evaluations for each piece of evidence based on its relevance to the claim and the video in question:

1. **evidence0**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 9
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses the phenomenon of supercooling and how water can remain liquid below freezing until disturbed. It directly addresses the claim of water transforming into a gelatinous substance, explaining that it's a process related to freezing and that the water can solidify suddenly under certain conditions. This helps debunk the claim as it shows there's no harmful transformation into a gelatinous substance.

2. **evidence1**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 7
   - **Justification**: This evidence recounts a personal experience involving sudden freezing, which is relevant in explaining the flash-freezing phenomenon. While it doesn't directly address the Walmart-brand water or the claim of a dangerous gelatin substance, it lends credibility to the idea of water quickly turning into ice, thereby indirectly supporting the argument against the claim.

3. **evidence2**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 8
   - **Justification**: This evidence describes the action of knocking a supercooled water bottle to create instant slush, which aligns well with the concepts presented in the video. It supports the idea that the transformation of water can happen rapidly but does not involve a gelatinous substance that is deemed dangerous.

4. **evidence3**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 3
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses an instance of gravy turning gelatinous, which is somewhat tangential and relates more to food science rather than to the claim directly involving water and its freezing properties. It provides minimal relevance to the specific claim about Walmart-brand water.

5. **evidence4**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 2
   - **Justification**: This evidence regarding homemade gel food for fish is unrelated to the claim and does not provide any useful insights into the properties of supercooled water or the transformation mentioned in the video. Hence, it is not relevant to the evaluation of the claim.

6. **evidence5**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 5
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses the effects of freezing on food texture and the release of moisture, but it does not specifically relate to the claim about Walmart-brand water or the transformation into a gelatin-like substance. Its contribution to understanding the claim is limited.

7. **evidence6**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 4
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses making a self-freezing slushy and references the supercooling phenomenon, but it does not directly correlate with the claim of dangerous gelatin transformation. It provides vague insights into freezing techniques without addressing the major claim.

8. **evidence7**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 1
   - **Justification**: This TikTok evidence may be visually interesting but lacks scientific explanation or relevance to the claim of a dangerous gelatin substance. It doesn't aid in discerning the truth of the claim.

9. **evidence8**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 6
   - **Justification**: This evidence refers to a simple experiment involving instant ice creation, which can shed light on the phenomena displayed in the video. However, like other evidence, it does not address the claim about a gelatinous transformation directly.

10. **evidence9**:
    - **RelevanceScore**: 8
    - **Justification**: This evidence provides a scientific explanation of supercooling and how it relates to freezing. It directly contributes to understanding the mechanisms that cause water to rapidly freeze but also highlights that it does not lead to any dangerous transformation, making it highly relevant to debunking the claim.

Overall, the stronger connections to the scientific principles of freezing and the specific phenomena viewed in the video yielded higher relevance scores.
2024-08-04 01:51:08 - ThreadPoolExecutor-3_0 - INFO - ################## Process RelevanceScore Output (Attempt 1) ##################
2024-08-04 01:51:08 - ThreadPoolExecutor-3_0 - INFO - Here is the evaluation of each piece of evidence based on the question "Does the video demonstrate Walmart-brand water transforming into a dangerous gelatin substance as claimed?":

1. **evidence0**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 2
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses Walmart providing kits to turn leftover opioids into a gel. While it mentions "gel," it is related to drug disposal and has no relevance to water turning into a gelatinous substance. 

2. **evidence1**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 2
   - **Justification**: Similar to evidence0, this also explains how Walmart's packets turn leftover medications into a gel for disposal purposes. It does not pertain to water or the transformation described in the claim.

3. **evidence2**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 1
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses the banning of water bead toys marketed towards children due to safety concerns, but it does not relate to Walmart-brand water turning into a dangerous gelatin substance. The connection to the claim is tenuous at best.

4. **evidence3**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 2
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses the DisposeRX packets that turn opioids into a gel but does not relate to the specific claim about water transforming into gelatin. 

5. **evidence4**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 2
   - **Justification**: Similar to evidence0 and evidence3, this information is about opioid disposal using a gel, which has no connection to the claim regarding water.

6. **evidence5**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 1
   - **Justification**: This evidence is about a specific personal lubricant product sold at Walmart and does not relate in any way to the topic of Walmart-brand water or gelatin substances.

7. **evidence6**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 2
   - **Justification**: This evidence is again focused on opioid disposal, reinforcing the information in previous evidences about turning solids into gel for safe disposal, but it holds no relevance to the claim concerning water.

8. **evidence7**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 0
   - **Justification**: This evidence is completely unrelated to the claim about Walmart water and discusses an unrelated kitchen issue regarding chicken texture.

9. **evidence8**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 1
   - **Justification**: This evidence alludes to a social media trend involving gel blasters but does not provide any direct connection to water or Walmart's water transforming into a gel.

10. **evidence9**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 1
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses a shooting incident related to a water gel blaster but does not mention Walmart-brand water or gelatinization, thus having minimal relevance to the claim.

Overall, each piece of evidence provides minimal to no corroborative information regarding the claim about Walmart-brand water changing into a gelatinous substance as described in the video.

  "video_transcript": "In just 3 easy steps, you'll be able to flash freeze a bottle of water just by touching it. Next, you'll learn how to freeze flowing water the instant support from the bottle, and your training will be complete when you can eliminate the bottle altogether. Now, this might seem slightly supernatural, but you don't have to be a master to do it. In this project, we're discovering the secrets to ice bending in real life. For this project, we'll be using these bottles of purified water. I've got the 16.9 ounce bottles, and they've never been opened, so the water is extremely pure. Now the secret to instant ice is just about as simple as placing your bottles in the freezer. I let these ones sit for 2 hours 45 minutes exactly, and here you can see the water is still liquid, but it's actually cooled down to a temperature well below freezing. All it takes from this point is a sharp jolt to the bottle, and you can see the water flash freezes to ice right in the palm of your hand. How cool is that? You can also start the reaction by using an ice crystal, like one of these ice cubes. Just carefully remove the cap from the bottle, and pour the water directly onto the ice. The water immediately begins to crystallize, giving you the power to create your own instant ice sculptures. The end result is a slush that has the consistency of a watery snowball, which of course, is 100% edible and refreshingly delicious. Now try pouring your supercooled water into a clean glass, and drop a bit of ice right in the center. You'll see the ice crystal begins to grow until it fills the glass completely. That's perfectly chilled for a hot summer's day. Alright. Let's finish up by dipping just the tip of an ice cube in to see what happens. Within a couple of seconds, it's frozen in place, and the entire cup is solid. Well, now you know the secret to pouring yourself some instant ice, and making water freeze on command. Now, if you'd like to see more of the technical details, check out my other video with tips, tricks, and things to watch out for when making Instant Ice. That's it for now. If you liked this project, perhaps you'll like some of my others. Check them out at thekingofrandom.com.",
  "Video_descriptor": "The video captures a sequence where a man and a woman engage in a series of actions involving water and drink preparation. It commences with the man pouring water into a glass, followed by the woman pouring water into a bowl. Subsequently, the man adds ice to the glass while the woman adds strawberries to the bowl. The man proceeds to pour a liquid into the glass, and the woman inserts a straw. The video concludes with a shot focused on the drink in the glass. Spatially, the changes are confined to the movements of the participants and the addition of a straw to the drink. The key frames further enrich the narrative: the first key frame features a child blowing on a bottle of water outdoors, surrounded by lush greenery, suggesting a sunny day in a garden or park. The second key frame comprises four distinct scenes, including dry ice production, a man urinating outdoors with 'URINE IGNITION' captioned, a lit butter candle, and a bowl of colorful water balloons. The third key frame presents a person manipulating a glowing, pinkish thread against a dark, starry background, hinting at a futuristic ambiance. In contrast, the fourth key frame depicts a blurred hand holding a mechanical tool against a dark, cosmic backdrop with overlaid words like 'EXPLORE' and 'DISCOVER,' emphasizing exploration and creation. The fifth key frame shows a hand holding an almost-empty water bottle against a backdrop of green foliage, possibly outdoors. In the sixth key frame, a yellow, reflective, 3D-rendered high-tech device containing a cautionary triangle logo is spotlighted. Lastly, the seventh key frame displays a cocktail glass filled with a blue beverage and a large ice cube, set amidst rocks and greenery, evoking a leisurely or celebratory ambiance. These key frames collectively provide diverse and intriguing visual elements that enhance the video's narrative of water manipulation and drink preparation, offering glimpses of playful, futuristic, and natural themes throughout the presentation."

Sometimes its frozen solid, sometimes it stays liquid, depending on when I put it in there. But here\u2019s the kicker, sometimes I will pull the bottle out, it will be liquid, but as soon as I open it, it starts to turn into ice, from the top down (it takes a few seconds for the entire bottle to freeze. Is there an explanation for this?  \n\\- Greg (age 26)  \nArmy, Iraq\nA:\nWe suspect that what\u2019s happening here is that the water in the bottles which did not freeze overnight was \"supercooled.\" Water normally freezes when it is cooled below 0 degrees Celsius, forming ice crystals. Ice crystals form more easily when they grow on existing ice crystals -- the water molecules like to pack themselves in place on a crystal that\u2019s already gotten started. It doesn\u2019t take much to start the crystallization process going -- a little piece of dust or other impurity in the water, or even a scratch on the bottle are sometimes all it takes to get ice crystals growing. The process of starting off a crystal is called \"nucleation.\"\nIn the absence of impurities in the water and imperfections in the bottle, the water can get \"stuck\" in its liquid state as it cools off, even below its freezing point. We say this supercooled state is \"metastable.\" The water will stay liquid until something comes along to nucleate crystal growth. A speck of dust, or a flake of frost from the screw-cap falling into the bottle are enough to get the freezing going, and the crystals will build on each other and spread through the water in the bottle.\nWater releases 80 calories per gram when turning from a liquid to a solid.

    "Useful": "yes",
    "Reason": "The evidence provided is highly relevant to the New_Question, which asks whether the video demonstrates Walmart-brand water transforming into a dangerous gelatin substance. The excerpts from the evidence detail the phenomenon of supercooled water, explaining how water can remain liquid at temperatures below freezing until disturbed. For instance, the content from the physics van explains 'supercooled' states and nucleation, illustrating how a sudden jolt to a bottle of supercooled water can cause it to freeze instantly, creating a slushy consistency, rather than a hazardous gelatin substance. This directly addresses the claim by indicating that the transformation is due to freezing, not any dangerous substance. Moreover, the sources cited, such as Steve Spangler and BBC Science Focus Magazine, are reputable and provide clear scientific explanations of the freezing process. Therefore, this evidence is useful for refuting the claim of a transformation into a 'dangerous gelatin substance' by relying on foundational principles of physics and chemistry regarding the behavior of supercooled water."

Shock waves from an in-built metallic 'clicker' are used in a new 'wine warmer' which contains a supercooled liquid that releases heat as it solidifies.\n**Read more:**\n*   \n*   \n_**Subscribe** to  for fascinating new Q&As every month and follow  on Twitter for your daily dose of fun science facts._\nShare this article\n------------------\n!\n*    Facebook]\n*    Twitter]\n*    Instagram]\n*    Pinterest]\n*    Youtube]\n*    RSS]\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \nThis website is owned and published by Our Media Ltd. www.ourmedia.co.uk\n© Our Media 2024\n!"

2024-08-04 01:51:27 - Thread-1 (process_claim_verification) - INFO - The claim that a video shows Walmart-brand water turning into a dangerous gelatin substance is not supported by the evidence from the video or from scientific understanding. In the video, the water undergoes a process known as supercooling, where it remains liquid even below its freezing point. When the bottle is jolted or disturbed, the supercooled water rapidly crystallizes into ice, appearing almost like a slushy substance, but it does not turn into a gelatinous material [Query2_evidence1]. 

Supercooling is explained in the scientific context; water, when cooled below 0°C can still remain liquid if there are no impurities or disturbances. The rapid freezing occurs because of a process called nucleation which can be triggered by small disturbances or impurities [Query2_evidence3]. This phenomenon is frequently demonstrated in experiments involving water bottles, where a sharp impact can cause the water to freeze almost instantly, creating ice formations but not a gelatin substance [Query2_evidence2]. 

Since the transformation described in the claim does not occur in the video—there is no gelatin substance formed, only slushy ice—this leads to the conclusion that the claim about the video is false.

Based on the analysis of the evidence and logical reasoning, I am 95% confident in this conclusion.

Now, this might seem slightly supernatural, but you don't have to be a master to do it. In this project, we're discovering the secrets to ice bending in real life. For this project, we'll be using these bottles of purified water. I've got the 16.9 ounce bottles, and they've never been opened, so the water is extremely pure. Now the secret to instant ice is just about as simple as placing your bottles in the freezer. I let these ones sit for 2 hours 45 minutes exactly, and here you can see the water is still liquid, but it's actually cooled down to a temperature well below freezing. All it takes from this point is a sharp jolt to the bottle, and you can see the water flash freezes to ice right in the palm of your hand. How cool is that? You can also start the reaction by using an ice crystal, like one of these ice cubes. Just carefully remove the cap from the bottle, and pour the water directly onto the ice. The water immediately begins to crystallize, giving you the power to create your own instant ice sculptures. The end result is a slush that has the consistency of a watery snowball, which of course, is 100% edible and refreshingly delicious. Now try pouring your supercooled water into a clean glass, and drop a bit of ice right in the center. You'll see the ice crystal begins to grow until it fills the glass completely. That's perfectly chilled for a hot summer's day. Alright. Let's finish up by dipping just the tip of an ice cube in to see what happens.
