When mixed with warm water, the powder turns the pills into a biodegradable gel that can be thrown in the trash.\nResearch has shown that surgery patients often end up with leftover opioid painkillers and store the drugs improperly at home\nWalmart says the powder also works with other prescription drugs. The company says its pharmacy customers can request a free packet at any time.\nClose Ad\n#### More Videos\n!\nNext up in 5\nExample video title will go here for this video\n*   !\n    Next up in 5\n    Example video title will go here for this video\n*   !\n*   !\n*   !\n*   !\nIn Other News\n#### U.S. Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates soon\nBefore You Leave, Check This Out\n--------------------------------\n!\n!\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n\u00a9 2024 WVEC-TV.

Walmart announced new moves Monday, Oct. 9, 2017, to speed up the return process for online purchases, including letting some shoppers keep the stuff they don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want and still get a refund.

When mixed with warm water, the powder turns the pills into a biodegradable gel that can be thrown in the trash.\nIt works on other prescription drugs and for pills, tablets, capsules, liquids or patches, according to DisposeRx.\nAround 4 million Americans are addicted to prescription painkillers, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.

DisposeRx provides a virtually effortless way for patients to destroy leftover opioids and a way to do so without ever leaving home. \nThe innovative disposal solution will now be provided in addition to ongoing counseling available to Walmart patients on proper opioid use when filling an opioid prescription at any one of its 4,700 pharmacies nationwide.

The chicken is fully cooked through (I can tell based on internal temp, time in the oven, color of the chicken and juices), but the texture of the chicken is funny, almost like it hasn't been thoroughly cooked.  When I cut into the chicken I feel resistance (like you would when butchering raw chicken rather than cutting/carving cooked chicken) and there is a strange almost squeaky mouth feel.  This has happened to me  with bone in, skin on chicken breasts and also skinless boneless breasts.  Usually when this happens to me, there are some pieces of chicken that are fine, but others that are decidedly not.  At first, I thought it was a result of cooking frozen chicken that hadn't fully thawed.  But last night, this happened when I roasted some never frozen bone in breasts from the fridge.  Could this have something to do with how I'm cooking the meat?  Or is it a sad byproduct of factory farmed chicken breasts?

A document that 12 News obtained details circumstances surrounding the shooting of an 18-year-old and the arrest of 47-year-old Ruben Contreras.\nContreras is charged with attempted first-degree murder in connection with the May 11 shooting of the teen.\nCourt documents say the teen and two of his friends were driving around the Walmart parking, allegedly shooting a gel blaster at people. Contreras\u2019 daughter was one of the people the teens allegedly shot at.

Contreras remained at the scene and was taken into custody.\nThe shooting highlights a social media game called the \u201cOrbeez Challenge.\u201d in which teens use a gel blaster that shoots water-based gel beads. Across the U.S., police report seeing cases where kids take the challenge too far, even freezing the beads.
