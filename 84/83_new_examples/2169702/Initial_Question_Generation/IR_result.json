The company says that the popular water bead brand Orbeez will now be prohibited and that water beads sold as ammunition for “gel blaster” guns will not be allowed if they are marketed for children.\nWalmart tells CR it will prohibit the sale of all water bead toys and craft supplies that are marketed for children under age 9, both in stores and online.\nTarget initially declined to comment, but after the publication of this story, the company told CR that it has also decided to change its policy regarding water beads.\n“At Target, our top priority is the safety of our guests,” said Emily Bisek, a Target spokesperson. “Given growing safety...[Content truncated]",

(KWCH) - New information released Wednesday provides information into what police said led up to . A document that 12 News obtained details circumstances surrounding the shooting of an 18-year-old and the arrest of 47-year-old Ruben Contreras.\nContreras is charged with attempted first-degree murder in connection with the May 11 shooting of the teen.\nCourt documents say the teen and two of his friends were driving around the Walmart parking, allegedly shooting a gel blaster at people. Contreras’ daughter was one of the people the teens allegedly shot at. She called her father.\nDetectives said Contreras arrived in the parking lot and attempted to confront the teens as they were in a car backing out of a parking space. That’s when Contreras ran to the driver’s side and appeared to pull out a gun, firing one round into the vehicle, and striking the driver. The car continued forward and crashed.\nThe driver remained in the car while his friends ran away, police said. Contreras remained at the scene and was taken into custody.\nThe shooting highlights a social media game called the “Orbeez Challenge.” in which teens use a gel blaster that shoots water-based gel beads. Across the U.S., police report seeing cases where kids take the challenge too far, even freezing the beads. The action leads to criminal charges.\nThis week, 12 News is taking a closer look into the issues surrounding the “Orbeez Challenge.” We spoke with a teen named Tomas...[Content truncated]",

Sometimes its frozen solid, sometimes it stays liquid, depending on when I put it in there. But here’s the kicker, sometimes I will pull the bottle out, it will be liquid, but as soon as I open it, it starts to turn into ice, from the top down (it takes a few seconds for the entire bottle to freeze. Is there an explanation for this?  \n\\- Greg (age 26)  \nArmy, Iraq\nA:\nWe suspect that what’s happening here is that the water in the bottles which did not freeze overnight was \"supercooled.\" Water normally freezes when it is cooled below 0 degrees Celsius, forming ice crystals. Ice crystals form more easily when they grow on existing ice crystals -- the water molecules like to pack themselves in place on a crystal that’s already gotten started. It doesn’t take much to start the crystallization process going -- a little piece of dust or other impurity in the water, or even a scratch on the bottle are sometimes all it takes to get ice crystals growing. The process of starting off a crystal is called \"nucleation.\"\nIn the absence of impurities in the water and imperfections in the bottle, the water can get \"stuck\" in its liquid state as it cools off, even below its freezing point. We say this supercooled state is \"metastable.\" The water will stay liquid until something comes along to nucleate crystal growth. A speck of dust, or a flake of frost from the screw-cap falling into the bottle are enough to get the freezing going, and the crystals will build on each other and spread through the water in the bottle.\nWater releases 80 calories per gram when turning from a liquid to a solid. We suspect your freezer is only a few degrees Celsius below zero(perhaps ten or fifteen?), and the specific heat of water is one...[Content truncated]",

            "content": "_Most recent answer: 10/22/2007_\nQ:\nI put a bottle of water in the freezer every night before bed. In the morning, I take it out and drink it. Sometimes its frozen solid, sometimes it stays liquid, depending on when I put it in there. But here’s the kicker, sometimes I will pull the bottle out, it will be liquid, but as soon as I open it, it starts to turn into ice, from the top down (it takes a few seconds for the entire bottle to freeze. Is there an explanation for this?  \n\\- Greg (age 26)  \nArmy, Iraq\nA:\nWe suspect that what’s happening here is that the water in the bottles which did not freeze overnight was \"supercooled.\" Water normally freezes when it is cooled below 0 degrees Celsius, forming ice crystals. Ice crystals form more easily when they grow on existing ice crystals -- the water molecules like to pack themselves in place on a crystal that’s already gotten started. It doesn’t take much to start the crystallization process going -- a little piece of dust or other impurity in the water, or even a scratch on the bottle are sometimes all it takes to get ice crystals growing. The process of starting off a crystal is called \"nucleation.\"\nIn the absence of impurities in the water and imperfections in the bottle, the water can get \"stuck\" in its liquid state as it cools off, even below its freezing point. We say this supercooled state is \"metastable.\" The water will stay liquid until something comes along to nucleate crystal growth. A speck of dust, or a flake of frost from the screw-cap falling into the bottle are enough to get the freezing going, and the crystals will build on each other and spread through the water in the bottle.\nWater releases 80 calories per gram when turning from a liquid to a solid. We suspect your freezer is only a few degrees Celsius below zero(perhaps ten or fifteen?), and the specific heat of water is one...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "Does the video demonstrate Walmart-brand water transforming into a dangerous gelatin substance as claimed?",
        "Answer": "The claim that a video shows Walmart-brand water turning into a dangerous gelatin substance is not supported by the evidence from the video or from scientific understanding. In the video, the water undergoes a process known as supercooling, where it remains liquid even below its freezing point. When the bottle is jolted or disturbed, the supercooled water rapidly crystallizes into ice, appearing almost like a slushy substance, but it does not turn into a gelatinous material. Supercooling is explained in the scientific context; water, when cooled below 0°C can still remain liquid if there are no impurities or disturbances. The rapid freezing occurs because of a process called nucleation which can be triggered by small disturbances or impurities. This phenomenon is frequently demonstrated in experiments involving water bottles, where a sharp impact can cause the water to freeze almost instantly, creating ice formations but not a gelatin substance. Since the transformation described in the claim does not occur in the video—there is no gelatin substance formed, only slushy ice—this leads to the conclusion that the claim about the video is false.",
