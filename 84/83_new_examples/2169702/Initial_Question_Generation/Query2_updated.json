Sometimes its frozen solid, sometimes it stays liquid, depending on when I put it in there. But here\u2019s the kicker, sometimes I will pull the bottle out, it will be liquid, but as soon as I open it, it starts to turn into ice, from the top down (it takes a few seconds for the entire bottle to freeze. Is there an explanation for this?  \n\\- Greg (age 26)  \nArmy, Iraq\nA:\nWe suspect that what\u2019s happening here is that the water in the bottles which did not freeze overnight was \"supercooled.\" Water normally freezes when it is cooled below 0 degrees Celsius, forming ice crystals. Ice crystals form more easily when they grow on existing ice crystals -- the water molecules like to pack themselves in place on a crystal that\u2019s already gotten started. It doesn\u2019t take much to start the crystallization process going -- a little piece of dust or other impurity in the water, or even a scratch on the bottle are sometimes all it takes to get ice crystals growing. The process of starting off a crystal is called \"nucleation.\"\nIn the absence of impurities in the water and imperfections in the bottle, the water can get \"stuck\" in its liquid state as it cools off, even below its freezing point. We say this supercooled state is \"metastable.\" The water will stay liquid until something comes along to nucleate crystal growth. A speck of dust, or a flake of frost from the screw-cap falling into the bottle are enough to get the freezing going, and the crystals will build on each other and spread through the water in the bottle.\nWater releases 80 calories per gram when turning from a liquid to a solid. We suspect your freezer is only a few degrees Celsius below zero(perhaps ten or fifteen?), and the specific heat of water is one...[Content truncated]",

So here is one recipe for doing that. Note that there are many ways to vary this and none are the \u201cright\u201d way.\nTo make one variation of gel tropical fish food get the following ingredients:\nHeat the meat and algae to hot.\u00a0 Then heat one cup water to boiling. Add one and one half ounce of gelatin powder to the one cup of water.\u00a0 Stir the gelatin/boiling water mixture till the gelatin dissolves. Let both mixtures cool till they are safe to handle but still very hot. Then put both the hot gelatin/water and the hot algae/meat in a blender. Blend all this thoroughly to make a hot viscous green putty-like material. Adjust the water content to get this wet putty consistency.\nThis hot viscous putty should then be solidified as 3 mm (1/8 inch) thick slabs in zip lock bags in a freezer. It is important that the gel food be a thin slab. A thin slab is easy to break up and will rapidly defrost and break up in the water. Alternatively one can use candy molds to make cubes or whatever shape one desires. Or you can put it in baking pans or plastic tubs and just cut cubes out as you need them.\nThis well gelled cold material can be just used as is, just cutting off or breaking...[Content truncated]",

Ascorbic acid may be used in its pure form or in commercial mixtures with sugars.\n*   Soaking the fruit in dilute vinegar solutions or coating the fruit with sugar and lemon juice doesn't prevent browning as effectively as treatment with ascorbic acid.\n### Limit air\u00a0during freezing\nAir exposure can cause frozen products to develop rancid oxidative flavors. Keep frozen food in airtight containers or use wrapping material that does not permit air to pass into the product. Also,\u00a0remove as much air as possible from the freezer bag or container to reduce the amount of air in contact with the product.\nChanges in texture during freezing\n----------------------------------\nWater makes up over 90 percent of the weight of most fruits and vegetables. Water and other chemicals are held within the fairly rigid cell walls that give structure\u00a0and texture to the fruit or vegetable. When you freeze fruits and vegetables you actually are freezing the water in the plant cells.\nWhen the water freezes, it expands and the ice crystals cause the cell walls to rupture. So the texture of thawed produce is much softer than when it was raw. This is particularly true of food that is usually eaten raw. For example, when a frozen tomato is thawed, it becomes mushy and watery.\nCelery and lettuce are not usually frozen because of this and we suggest that you serve frozen fruits before they have completely thawed. Partially thawed fruit is more appetizing when the effect of freezing on the fruit tissue is less noticeable.\nTextural changes due to freezing are not as apparent in products that are cooked before eating because cooking also softens cell walls. These changes are also less noticeable in high starch vegetables, such as peas, corn\u00a0and lima beans.\n### Freeze food as quickly as possible\n*   Avoid mushy fruits and vegetables by freezing produce as quickly as possible.\n*   In rapid freezing, a large number of small ice crystals are formed. Small ice crystals produce less cell wall rupture than slow freezing, which produces only a few large ice crystals.\n*   Some home freezer manuals recommend that you set the freezer temperature...[Content truncated]",

This is much harder to do that opening a tab, but it is possible, and the soda has the same properties as the stuff from the bottles.\n!\nObviously?\nI also experimented with 2 litter bottles, and had great results freezing them between 4-5 hours. The whole bottle slushifies in an instant if you shake it upside down for a second.\n!\nI experimented with Gatorade, Fresca, Mexican Sprite, Rootbeer, Orange sodas, Coke, Diet Coke, in bottle form, as well as in cans. I had super cooled success with them all!\n!\n!\n!\nRemoving the pressure very slowly from the bottle, can keep the soda liquified, and give you the choice opportunity to play with supercooled soda outside of the bottle.\nWell, there you have it! That's how to freeze soda instantly.\nIf you're not a soda drinker, you can do this same trick with water!\nVideo Loading\nIf you like this project perhaps you'll like some of my others.

That's because it needs something to kick-start the freezing process and encourage a small number of the liquid molecules to get together in a regular arrangement, as they do in a crystal, instead of moving around independently as they do in the liquid.\nThe process is called nucleation, because it encourages the molecules in the liquid to form a crystal-like nucleus onto which others can then latch. The kick-start can be given by a piece of dust, a rough spot on the surface of a container, or the shock wave generated when you hit a bottle just out of the freezer. Shock waves from an in-built metallic 'clicker' are used in a new 'wine warmer' which contains a supercooled liquid that releases heat as it solidifies.\n**Read more:**\n*   \n*   \n_**Subscribe** to  for fascinating new Q&As every month and follow  on Twitter for your daily dose of fun science facts._\nShare this article\n------------------\n!\n*    Facebook]\n*    Twitter]\n*    Instagram]\n*    Pinterest]\n*    Youtube]\n*    RSS]\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \nThis website is owned and published by Our Media Ltd. www.ourmedia.co.uk\n\u00a9 Our Media 2024\n!",
