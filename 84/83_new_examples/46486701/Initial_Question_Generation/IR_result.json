Running through the end of December, the Health Ticket — or  — is a relaunch of a campaign that Sports Festival ran last year, with people in Cluj doing over 1 million squats in 99 days.\nThe aim isn't just to get people moving for a bus ticket, but to inspire them to adopt a more active lifestyle. After doing twenty squats in front of the kiosk, they might do another set at home, or even decide to make physical exercise part of their daily routine.\nTrend Bite\nThis isn't the first time people have been able to swap physical exercise for free rides. , and  as part of the country's 'Fit India' program.\nThe appeal is evident: organizers get people moving and participants are immediately rewarded for their exertion. Since promoting both physical exercise and public transport is a double win for public health, one to keep spreading to other towns and cities? And with  in mind, how about including a different type of exercise for people who aren't physically capable of doing squats?\n18 October 2021\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpotted by: \nJoin 100,000+ future-focused professionals in 180 countries already receiving our free trend updates.\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\" class=\"em_wrapper\" style=\"table-layout:fixed; background-color:#...[Content truncated]",
