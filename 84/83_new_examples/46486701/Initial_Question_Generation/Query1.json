Selected by our experts, delivered daily.\nTwenty squats for a free bus ticket\n===================================\nIn the Romanian city of Cluj-Napoca, citizens can get a free bus ticket if they do twenty squats in front of a special kiosk. Running through the end of December, the Health Ticket — or  — is a relaunch of a campaign that Sports Festival ran last year, with people in Cluj doing over 1 million squats in 99 days.\nThe aim isn't just to get people moving for a bus ticket, but to inspire them to adopt a more active lifestyle. After doing twenty squats in front of the kiosk, they might do another set at home, or even decide to make physical exercise part of their daily routine.\nTrend Bite\nThis isn't the first time people have been able to swap physical exercise for free rides. , and  as part of the country's 'Fit India' program.\nThe appeal is evident: organizers get people moving and participants are immediately rewarded for their exertion. Since promoting both physical exercise and public transport is a double win for public health, one to keep spreading to other towns and cities? And with  in mind, how about including a different type of exercise for people who aren't physically capable of doing squats?\n18 October 2021\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpotted by: \nJoin 100,000+ future-focused professionals in 180 countries already receiving our free trend updates.\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\" class=\"em_wrapper\" style=\"table-layout:fixed; background-color:#...[Content truncated]",

Usually, such a ticket costs RON 2.5 (0.5 EUR) in Cluj-Napoca and can be now be earned by doing 20 squats in two minutes.\nThe project aimed to encourage the general public to find ways to introduce sport/movement into their daily routine. The movement chosen to be included in the project is a basic one, with a major health benefit for those who choose to include it in their daily lives.\nThe squats-for-tickets scheme launched last year consisted of a booth equipped with a video camera that was placed at the Memorandumului Sud bus station. It was promoted by the Sports Festival with the support of the City Hall and the Cluj-Napoca Local Council. The pilot was expected to only run for two weeks but it proved so successful it continued until the end of the year. It was supported by private partners NTT DATA Romania, AROBS and Terapia, who agreed to cover the cost of tickets. There were 14,500 health tickets issued during the initial two weeks of the pilot alone, well above expectations and initial calculations.\nSports...[Content truncated]",
