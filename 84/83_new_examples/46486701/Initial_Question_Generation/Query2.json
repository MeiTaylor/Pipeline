Selected by our experts, delivered daily.\nTwenty squats for a free bus ticket\n===================================\nIn the Romanian city of Cluj-Napoca, citizens can get a free bus ticket if they do twenty squats in front of a special kiosk. Running through the end of December, the Health Ticket — or  — is a relaunch of a campaign that Sports Festival ran last year, with people in Cluj doing over 1 million squats in 99 days.\nThe aim isn't just to get people moving for a bus ticket, but to inspire them to adopt a more active lifestyle. After doing twenty squats in front of the kiosk, they might do another set at home, or even decide to make physical exercise part of their daily routine.\nTrend Bite\nThis isn't the first time people have been able to swap physical exercise for free rides. , and  as part of the country's 'Fit India' program.\nThe appeal is evident: organizers get people moving and participants are immediately rewarded for their exertion. Since promoting both physical exercise and public transport is a double win for public health, one to keep spreading to other towns and cities? And with  in mind, how about including a different type of exercise for people who aren't physically capable of doing squats?\n18 October 2021\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpotted by: \nJoin 100,000+ future-focused professionals in 180 countries already receiving our free trend updates.\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\" class=\"em_wrapper\" style=\"table-layout:fixed; background-color:#...[Content truncated]",

Instead, it requires you to do 20 squats for a free bus ride in exchange. And Romanians love it.\n] by \n26 October 2022\n/\n!\nPhoto:@facebook.com/sportsfestivalcom\nAn increasing number of European cities have  for their citizens, assuming that minimizing the use of cars is a healthy habit. And indeed, it is, both for the passengers who take more walks and . Still, many cities feel that free fares would be too much of a blow to their budgets and stick to the old ways.\nThe Romanian city of Cluj-Napoca is on the latter side of this politics, but boy, have they introduced a peculiar currency to pay for their bus fares! Squatting. Yup, you read it right: squats, as in the exercise where you bend your knees from standing positions as low as you can and then stand up again. If you do it twenty times – you get a free bus ride.\n20 squats per ride\n------------------\nHow do they check if someone has completed their squats? Well, that’s where a smart city device comes in. It’s a kiosk  that watches you as you take on the challenge, which means doing 20 squats in under two minutes. One such booth in Cluj-Napoca is located on Memorandumului Street next to an actual bus stop, so you break some sweat,  get your ticket, and immediately hop on a bus. Alternatively, you may save your ticket for later, as it is valid across the entire transportation network.\n]\n]\nPhotos: courtesy of Sportsfestival.com\nSadly, this is not an all-year-round policy. The project was introduced in , and squatting-for-tickets were available from August until October, between 5 am and 11 pm. The current project, running for the third year in a row, launched in August 2022 and ends in October 2022.\nYou may say that a single-travel bus ticket in exchange for 20 squats is not that much of a benefit. In Cluj-Napoca, such a ticket may be worth RON lei 2.5 Romanian Leu (which is approximately EUR 0.5). But just think of all the health benefits,...[Content truncated]",

Photo / Sports Festival, Facebook\nThis summer European countries have been trying to get more travellers on public transport. Next month, Spain is making all intercity rail travel free to use and Germany has introduced an all-you-can ride €9 Fahrschein.\nBut Romania wants you to earn your fare.\nThe town of Cluj-Napoca has introduced a smart ticketing booth that will reward sporty citizens. It dispenses free bus tickets to those who can complete 20 squats in two minutes.\nAvailable between the hours of 8am and 8pm the 'Health Ticket' is the creation of local marketing agency SYKES Romania. Those successfully completing the challenge are given a one way fare - equivalent to 2.50 RON ($1).\nA similar initiative was launched in 2020 for European Sports Week, which resulted in 1 million squats and 55,000 free bus passes.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\n!\nIn Germany, uptake of rail tickets are up 42 per cent on pre-pandemic levels. Photo / Markus Winkler, Unsplash\nThe Sports Festival confirmed that the health ticket scheme would be extended from August 2022 until 1 February 2023.\nSummer of free transport adds up\n--------------------------------\nWhile a regional bus pass for Transylvania won't get you far, much of Europe has been joining forces to incentivise use of public transport.\nFrom September to the end of the year travel across some services with Spanish state-owned rail-network, Renfe, will be completely free. Subsidised medium-distance inter-regional travel and multi-stop tickets will be available to Spanish citizens and tourists.\nAdvertisement\nIn May, Deutsche Bahn, the German national rail network, launched a €9-a-month ticket which runs from June until August.

There’s an elliptical in our basement with which I am not unacquainted. But exercise to me has always been a chore, something to get out of the way.

Apparently, just installing a fitness app on your phone doesn’t make you fitter.\nSo: the gym and two hours a week, one-on-one with Michael.\nIt’s all about the core, I’m learning.
